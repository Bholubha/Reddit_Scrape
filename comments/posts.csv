17,Recapping a recent trip to the maldives - this might be useful for first time travellers,ztsq9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/maldives/comments/ztsq9r/recapping_a_recent_trip_to_the_maldives_this/,38,2,2022-12-23 21:10:30 UTC,maldives,jfphenom,"Hey all, I recently took a trip to the Maldives with my wife for our 10 year anniversary. I was hoping to make it like a second honeymoon, and for the most part I'd say it worked out. I'll give a full rundown of our trip so you can compare and hear from experience- this is a post I wish I'd been able to read before booking.

I wanted to experience as much of the Maldives as possible, so we island-hopped and visited a locals island (Maafushi) for 2 days, then a 4-star resort (Komandoo), then a 5-star resort (Conrad Rangali).

Maafushi:
I picked this based on this subreddit. My thinking here was that I'd be jet-lagged from a 12-hour time difference and 30 hours of travelling, and for the most part that was correct. I stayed at Arena Beach for about $200/night. One of the other huge benefits of Arena Beach was that they had really cheap excursions. When I was looking at booking excursions through Conrad or Komandoo, it was often like $90/pp for a 1-hour snorkeling excursion. At Arena Beach, we paid $45/pp for a 5 hour excursion that included lunch where we snorkeled with nurse sharks, stingrays, watched dolphins, and had lunch at a sand bar.

I felt very safe on Maafushi. The traveller crowds there were more diverse than at resorts- My wife and I are both American and we got asked twice during our two-day stay by other travellers from Indo-Asian countries if they could get a picture with us. That wasn't a big deal- just something I found unusual.

With all of that being said- I would have skipped doing a locals island after doing that and a resort. Cost-wise, it was very cheap, but the island experience itself isn't anything you can't get at Hawaii (or even Florida), and I found the food to not be very palatable to somebody accustomed to american dining. Once again, it was all pretty cheap, but I would have struggled to eat the food on the island for a whole week. The big upside was the excursions. From that perspective, it might be worth doing a one-day stayover if you really want to save on excursions, but IMO if you are travelling across the world you should just stay at a resort if you can afford it since the resort experiences were way more special.

Komandoo:
After day 2, we took a speedboat back to Male and then went via seaplane to Komandoo for 3 nights. One thing that surprised me is that the seaplane did not provide ear protection for us- I thought that would be basic for all seaplane transfers, but out of our 4 seaplane flights only 1 of the 4 gave us hearing protection. So, FYI- I'd bring your own ear plugs on your trip.

At Komandoo, I booked a beach villa with full-board. I skipped out on All-Inclusive since my wife is pregnant and we would not be drinking alcohol on this trip. Our all-in price was around $3200 - I think it came out to $800/night for room+board and another $800 for seaplane transfers.

Komandoo was a dream. We snorkeled for 2-hours every day we were here because their reef is teeming with life. Everywhere on this island felt like it could be in a post-card. The beach villas are the closest to where dinner is served and we think that also played into our enjoyment- overwater villas here will have to walk over a quarter mile (~550m) to get from the villas to where the restaurant, infinity pool, gym, and reception area are. 

We also opted to dine at the 5.8' underwater restaurant, which came out to $642 for the food plus $50 for the speedboat transfer. We loved the underwater restaurant experience and are so glad we did it, however I'd be remiss if I didn't set expectations that the food is not fantastic for the price. Don't get me wrong- the food isn't bad, but you are paying a premium for the underwater experience. If you've done other tasting menus where you paid $250+ in the USA, you will find that the underwater restaurant is a tier below those. One other thing to note here is that this restaurant has 10 total tables, but the tables in the middle or end are much better than the tables near the door. Our speedboat got us there in the middle of the pack so we were able to get a table right in the middle (which was great), but I felt bad for the couples that arrived last. The mid to end tables have a reef right next to them so there are fish constantly right next to you, but the tables near the door don't have a reef, so the fish are more distant, and one of you will also be facing the wall. Be ye warned- make sure and show up early for this if you have control over it.

The buffet food at Komandoo was excellent. There was always an assortment of breads, fruits, and made-to-order dishes. We had sushi + sashimi the first night which was on-par with $18 sushi roll places you find in the US. The meats they cooked were great, as were the pasta dishes- honestly, I thought this was just an overall great setup.

Oh, and the best part about komandoo- you didn't need sandals anywhere on the island. If Komandoo is on your short-list, I'd highly recommend it.

The last place- Conrad Rangali for 2 nights:
OK, so we took a seaplane at 9am from Komandoo back to Male, then our flight to Conrad was about 40 minutes after we landed. Conrad did have a nicer airport lounge than Komandoo with a better drink selection and a decent set of breakfast options with donuts, muffins, cereal, and fruit.

When we got to Conrad we were greeted with a coconut drink. It was delicious and felt right since the Maldives is basically paradise. I opted to get a Hilton Amex card which granted me Hilton Gold status for this trip because Gold+Diamond members get free breakfast, and at this resort the food is wayyy expensive- breakfast would be something like $45/pp every day, so the $95 credit card fee paid for itself twice over.

At Conrad, I booked an overwater sunset villa for something like $1600/night. 3 weeks before our trip I noticed that prices had fluctuated and dropped to 1400/night. Now, one more perk of Hilton Gold is that you get free room upgrades if available, so I talked to somebody at Conrad and explained that since prices had dropped I was hoping to just lock in an upgrade to the deluxe overwater villa which was currently going for the rate which I had paid for the standard overwater villa. They went ahead and locked me in, so overall I was happy that I got one of the bigger rooms although if I were to do this again, I would wait until just a week or two before booking as it looked like there was still availability for every room type. Maybe in peak season this is more problematic, but as far as I can tell most resorts don't operate at capacity.


Anyways, on the adults only side of Conrad (where most of the overwater villas are), there isn't a reef. So, while we could go swim in the ocean directly from our patio, there was not a whole lot of fish out there. That being said, we did see a shark ray from the bathtub and some squids as well as several reef sharks and other assorted fish. The house reef for Conrad is located on the bigger island and we had to take a golf cart to get there. In fact, we had to take a golf cart to most destinations on Conrad just since things are so far away. One other thing that surprised me here is that the beach villas weren't nearly as on-the-beach as they were at Komandoo. They felt a little more secluded with a small pathway surrounded by trees, whereas at Komandoo your patio felt like you were at the edge of the beach. Now, I didn't stay at a beach villa here but this is what I observed as I walked past them- I'm pretty sure that you couldn't look outside your window there and see the ocean horizon clearly. That being said, Conrad also has a handful of really cool picture setups scattered about the island that are perfect for instagram.

Overall, Conrad almost felt too big after being at Komandoo. And we opted for the a la carte food options, which turned out to be very pricey (although the food was delicious). Also, Conrad does a real good job with the settings- we ate at Ufaa and dined on the beach during sunset and it was lovely. I think at Ufaa we ended up spending $195 and then we ate at Sunset Grill for something like $230. Obviously there is a little bit of flex depending on what you order, but with water at $15/bottle and most entrees in the $60-70 range I'd say it's pretty tough to get out of there for less than $80/pp per meal. Mocktails and smoothies were like $12-15 each, and a poolside chicken ceasar wrap was $32. On top of all that there is a 10% service fee and a 12% GST charge (which I don't understand), so you can basically add 22% on top of all food items (but you don't have to tip your waiters since the service fee is baked in).

So, after doing this trip, my big takeaway was that 3 islands was probably too many to do in a 7 day window. In hindsight, I think I would have preferred to have just done two islands but only one seaplane transfer. That being said, doing a seaplane transfer was still really cool- you get to see so many beautiful islands as you fly over the atolls and I'd recommend staying at a resort that requires a seaplane since that is a good experience in and of itself. However, they are pretty expensive and they take a lot of time.

If I was going to do two islands again, I'd probably try and find a mid-tier resort close to Male that you can speedboat to and then a seaplane one for the second leg of the trip.

Travel sites usually rank honeymoon destinations as Maldives or Tahiti as one and two depending on who you ask. I liked Maldives more than Tahiti personally, and honestly I'm surprised most Americans haven't made it a priority to get out there and see the islands. They are truly breathtaking and the snorkeling and diving are world class.

Anyways, I'm done rambling. I'm happy to answer any random questions you might have about going- you can even feel free to PM me if you find this down the road.",1.0,9862,False

I'm Faru, I'm 23 and I am a reservations and marketing manager for a hotel. I have been active at work since late 2020 after the reopening of borders.   


1. Split Stay/PCR Requirements 

If you are moving from one tourism establishment to another you need to submit a split stay form to the Ministry of Tourism. This will be done by the hotel or resort that you are staying with, so please ask the hotel you are CURRENTLY staying in, to help you do the procedures. 

PCR within 72hrs is required for entry to the Maldives upon arrival. PCR within 72hrs is required for departure as well, if you have stayed at a local inhabited island (Gulhi, Maafushi, Thulusdhoo etc.)   


Some resorts will require a valid PCR within the last 72 hours to check in to the resort. Usually if this is your first stay, you can use the PCR that you took for the arrival and check in. Please check with your individual resort for their policies regarding COVID 19. 

&#x200B;

2. How is the internet?   
You can buy a tourist SIM with different internet packages at the airport. Yes it's mostly fast and sufficient to do video calls, video streaming and online meetings.   


3. Submitting the IMUGA Health Declaration.   
You can submit it any time prior to arrival and departure through the IMUGA online portal.   
Yes you need two, an arrival one and a departure one.   


4. Tell me a good resort, nearby island etc etc.   
Google is your friend. Specifically google maps. Read reviews. Make your own choice, please. This is a really tiring question because I'm a Maldivian and whenever I recommend a certain island or resort they think I know all about it but no.   
I personally recommend Maafushi, Thulusdhoo, Gulhi the most. Thoddoo is nice too but I haven't been there recently. NO FOLLOW UP questions.   


5. Can I get weed?   
You have zero chance of it by asking on reddit. If you're in Male' you can ask some shady guy at the street and take your chances. I'd give it about an 80% chance of working. Note: to my knowledge we don't have buds from the plant, we have hashish which is an extract from weed.   


6. Can I fly my drone?   
In the city, it's best not to. In an island or resort, it's best to ask the hotel you are staying first. At sea, yes.   


7. Can I use cash or card?   
Mostly you can pay at shops and most services using cards, however taxis, buses, ferries mostly will be only able to take cash. Everyone accepts USD and MVR both - not much other currencies.   


8. Extending my VISA.   
Generally tourist visas are valid for upto 30 days, and then you can extend it for another 30 days. Please ask your hotel/resort to help you with the process.   


9. Is the ferry available to x island?   
Most likely yes, however post covid I have noticed that most ferries have changed their schedules very much and is mostly used only for important and necessary cargo such as food items and other perishables, the best would be not to depend on it - take it if it is a convenience for you.   


10. What things can I do?   
Everything you see online about the particular island/resort is probably what you can expect to do. I live in Maafushi, and I will recommend watersports, day tours, fishing trips, snorkeling, scuba diving.

Me and my wife applied for jobs in Maldives recently. My wife was able to secure a job as a beautician and flew to Maldives in June. Her employer (a multi-national chain of hotels) sent her a legit work permit within a few days. Genuinely it all seemed like a great place to work. Here's the issue we're having now. **As soon as she flew in to her Island (place of work), the HR office had asked her to drop her passport & work contract off at them.** They told her they will convert her work permit into a work visa. However, it's been two months & she has not got her passport back. Later when she asked about it, the HR in the island office told her that all employee passports are permanently kept in their HQ at Mal√© City. **Now my wife's freaking out, because the act of withholding a passport is prohibited by law.** The company surely didn't explant anything about withholding a passport like this prior to her arrival. I have heard numerus cases where employees get trafficked and lose their passports this way. Do I have to fly there with a tourist visa to get her passport back and get her home? Really appreciate your help. Thanks in advance.",1.0,1180,False

---
In island of Fiyoaree, an old couple lived with their three daughters. The eldest girl was blind. One night the blind girl felt the urge to visit the toilet, so her sister Kaidda^1 accompanied her on a short journey to the beach near their house. As they strolled through darkness, something unusual was happening; the trees and palms who usually stood tall and silent were crouching on the ground, seemed like engaged in hushed exchange with each other. Upon reaching the beach, the sight was even more mesmerizing, water shimmered like a sheet of silver leaf, casting an otherworldly glow upon the entire coastline. Then something was wrong - the sea churned and bubbled as if boiling water.

 Terrified, they rushed home to awaken their father, Hussein Kaleygefaanu^(2), who witnessed the extraordinary sight of trees crouching down and talking to each other. As the old man looked on, the water well in front of his house began to froth and spill over. In astonishment, he hurried to the beach and witnessed the entire ocean churning towards the land. Amongst the turmoil, he saw various treasures like mollusks, shells, pots, pans, and shiny silverware floating about.

Gazing at the sky, he noticed the *gurus*^3 constellation shining brightly above, signaling the eve of the *hiya nakaiyy*^4 - and assumed it's the Night of Power^(5). Feeling a surge of excitement, he jumped into the water, retrieving the valuable items and rushing back home.

With his wife and two daughters, they returned to the beach to collect more treasures. Once they were done, the ocean calmed, and the surroundings returned to normal. They hid the treasures in their house, keeping this extraordinary experience a secret from everyone else on the island.

---

A year passed, and Hussain Kaleygefaanu traveled to Male' for business. The Sultan honored him with the title *""Maaradha""*^(6), making him a highly influential figure in the atoll, just after the chief tax collector^(7). He amassed great wealth, becoming one of the three richest individuals in the southern atolls. As time went on in the name of financial crises, the kingdom seized his properties - 7 times, but his wealth remained intact. Even after his death, his children inherited his riches and stayed wealthy.

The government even confiscated his children's properties, but they still remained prosperous. The family's most valuable land was the reed straw fields, owned by Maaradha Kaleygefaanu's wife, Beefanu^(8). In a desperate move, tax collectors were ordered to burn Beefanu's reed fields. To everyone's surprise, the burned fields eventually regenerated with higher quality reeds, proving the people of Fiyoaree that burning the fields resulted in better crops.

Years passed, and Kaidda became a woman with many children, around 40 boys. Sadly, a curse befell her family, causing her 40 sons to die, one by one, every Friday after prayer. The other two sisters remained single and Beefaanu, who never remarried, also passed away. But their wealth remained as prosperous as before. Legend says their house and a square sandstone well still stand on the island.

### Notes
1. Kaidda: Khadeeja (arabic). Kaidda Buya in original version, Lutfi explains Buya is an archaic honorific given to beautiful women; may likely be related to old dhivehi Bhu attested in pre-islamic inscriptions, see Gippert & Fritz explanation of the term (refer. Santi Mariyambu).  
2. Kaleygefaanu: In this context, the non hereditary honorific implies he is part of the island's elders or council. Unlike Kilegefaanu, it is not a ceremonially given title. 
3. Gurus: *Gurus* is a constellation. The term ""Gurus fenmathi vun"" may have be popularized by this story; although I haven't encountered anything written source regarding that. I'll have to go back and check any older nakaiy books, which I do not have access right now before I can verify this. 
4. Hiya Nakaiyy: Nakaiy (constellation) system, is the localized form the *nakshatra* system. 6^th nakaiy of Iruvai (north east monsoon) is actually called Hiyaviha which corresponds to Shatabhisha in classical Indian system.
5. Night of power: Laylat-ul-Qadr, a holy night which occurs at the end of Ramadan. The term is Arabic, so you can easily look it up on the internet and there's a lot more information.
6. Maaradha: A ceremonial chief, not a member of the inner council.
7. Vaaruveriya: The royal tax collector is usually equivalent to what we call the Atoll Chief in later periods. These folks had a lot more prestige than their later counterparts; all depending on the time period.
8. Beefaanu: Roughly translates to ""The Lady"". As Lutfi explains, Bee or Beevi is a borrowed term for woman. Suffix, 'faanu' implies a higher status.

I came across this article in the NYTimes Travel the other day that [The Maldives Knows Yolo](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/travel/the-maldives-knows-yolo.html). I'm seeing all of these mostly US honeymooners, tourists, remote workers posts in this subreddit.

It was my understanding that the Maldives was experiencing a fairly severe human rights crisis and the government was incredibly repressive. My understanding is that the repressive government is funded by these resorts and that the suffering citizens are hidden away, living in brutal conditions far from the eyes of western tourists. I seem to remember that the resorts were created an environmental crisis? I'm floored by what would be such staggering irresponsibility by westerners who have so much privilege... I don't even want to believe it.

I couldn't believe that the NY Times would be like, ""Forget the brutal suppression of political and religious freedom! There's wifi and cabanas!""

Am I wrong? To be fair, the last time I heard anything about the Maldives was a few years ago and I'm struggling to find more recent accurate resources. Have things changed? Is there repression of speech there or internet censorship there?
