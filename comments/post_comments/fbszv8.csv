0,fj6noar,My wife and I are making a trip to Ozen in April!  How are you liking it?  The good/the bad?  What kind of room are you staying in?  Any feedback would be much appreciated!,1,0,2020-03-01 15:24:08 UTC,4,Buckeye027,fbszv8,t3_fbszv8,172,False,False,maldives
1,fj6wxan,"Stayed for 10 days, all very good, great friendly staff and restaurants excellent. The only down side was the snorkelling trip - no coral and not a lot to see in the way of coloured fish. We stayed in the earth villas with a pool, a short walk of a few metres took us into the beautiful warm sea.
We had a great time and would recommend - enjoy",3,1,2020-03-01 16:58:21 UTC,2,Casaescoces,fbszv8,t1_fj6noar,344,False,True,maldives

3,fj92hg8,That sucks. With warming oceans and seas this seems to be the future for maldivian reefs.,2,2,2020-03-02 06:14:40 UTC,1,primary0,fbszv8,t1_fj6wxan,89,False,False,maldives
4,fj9eoiy,"I noticed that too, I went to the maldives for the first time in 2015 and the corals were really nice and there were many coloured fish in the reef, then 3 years later i went to the exact same spot again and the corals were dead and there were no more coloured fish out there but i think it's not only a problem of the warming oceans, it's also because of the tourists who just don't care and step on the corals everyday and all the trash people throw into the ocean.",2,3,2020-03-02 10:31:21 UTC,0,TsubasaOkocha,fbszv8,t1_fj92hg8,467,False,False,maldives
