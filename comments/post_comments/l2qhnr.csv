0,gk8jz7a,"This has to be one of the worst things done by any resort. It is unforgivable and they should be brought to face the consequences. The general manager should be fired and sent back. We have too many of these proud, narcissistic General Managers on their high horses thinking they can do whatever they want in our country.",7,0,2021-01-22 20:48:50 UTC,0,Voidvicer,l2qhnr,t3_l2qhnr,321,False,False,maldives
1,gkfe54y,"The Gili lankanfushi IG page is blocking anybody who is protesting on their page. Public image is their weak spot. The only way they will take responsibility is by exploiting it. Best thing to do it to gather groups of people and flood their pages, people with boats to surround the resort and protest loud enough for guests to hear because I am sure that they are sheltered away from what their staff did.",5,0,2021-01-23 19:06:28 UTC,0,Jojoangel684,l2qhnr,t3_l2qhnr,406,False,False,maldives

8,gkaqja9,"No, the sand bank was under the jurisdiction of K.Hinmafushi Council. It was open to locals.

The motive of them is not clear yet tho. But most locals believe it is an attempt to keep the locals away",6,2,2021-01-23 04:53:59 UTC,1,dhandehelu,l2qhnr,t1_gkanq8e,199,False,True,maldives
