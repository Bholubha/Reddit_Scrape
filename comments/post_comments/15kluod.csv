1,jv9e5we,Staying together is fine but knowingly bringing a thalassemic child into the world is cruel in my opinion. Thereâ€™s lots of ways to minimize the chance of having a thalassemic child as others have also covered. If you are both serious about having a child of your own and do not have the financial means to do all the necessary things such as IVF or embryo testing then you are probably not financially ready to properly care for a child with thalassemia either. I think it comes down to whether you really want a child together or to just spend your life together. Lots of couples nowadays are childless for a variety of reasons.,8,0,2023-08-08 04:48:10 UTC,0,islandtravel,15kluod,t3_15kluod,629,False,False,maldives

I suggest talking about it a bit more with your partner, and see if both of you can reach a final unanimous decision.

5,jva9qm0,"I donâ€™t think you should break up just because of that, there are medical options available now should you want to have a child.

6,jv959n4,"As a thalassemic patient myself. As in not a career but someone who has to take regular transfusions, my answer to this has always been don't break up JUST because of that. It is a controversial opinion yes and people usually disagree with me on this.  


First let me just give you the obvious options of adopting or as mentioned here the genetic engineering IVF avenues if you have the money. Though I am not 100% sure how viable that is. You should do a bit more research on that. But if any of those are an option for you, then I mean you have no issues right?  
On the issue of having an actual thalasemic child, here is how I see things. Even thalassemia aside life has no guarantees. You could get a child who requires some special care in another form. Yes marrying as career's raises that risk, but in a sense, it also gives you the chance to consider whether that is something both of you can face as a couple. There is a quote I quite like, It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease, than to know what sort of disease a person has. Here it is what sort of person you are that would matter. Even today due to lack of awareness a lot of people will see thalasemic's as sick. Sick in the sense they are weak and cannot do everything normal people does. But that is not true at all, with proper treatment, there are thalasemic's doing all sort of things. One even goes bodu kahneli fishing ah. As you know that is a very physically demanding job.  


What is most important to understand is that it's going to be physically, mentally and financially draining. Especially when the child is young and don't understand things, you are going to have to force them to take the proper treatment. They will cry and fight against it, and you will have to be strong enough to deal with that. And while there are now tablet medications that can be used, most thalasemic's still take medication through a syringe and a pump that has to be on them throughout the night on most nights. When I was doing thing it meant sacrificing evenings because I did not want to go out like that. But there are many that do. And if you can afford it there are small easy to carry pumps as well.  


Which comes to the financial aspect. Do not think that the government will take care of everything, so you don't have to worry. For one thing sometimes you have to spend for better quality of life than government provides. And while a lot of tests and stuff can be done here now, you must consider that sometimes you may have to go abroad, and even with all the social protection that is still quite a hassle, and can be financially burdensome. And then there is the whole thing of further studies like degrees and stuff. If the kid wants to go abroad for studies, unless in very rare circumstances you are going to have to foot the bill of their treatment, the government will not cover that. I faced this in my own studies.  


So I suppose the bottom line is can you handle all this, both financially, and as a couple. And the whole issue of putting your child through all this. Well that is a very difficult thing to answer and I suppose would depend on the kind of kid he/she turns out to be. I rarely if ever felt like bad for been a thalasemic. That would be a combination of my parents plus my own personality, so ofcours mileage is going to vary. But I think been a strong example for your child, and not treating them as like weak and sick will go far.  


If you have any people who you trust and knows the both of you well and will be honest with you talk to them. Ask for their honest opinion even if it will hurt you, see if they think you can handle all this, and your marriage will survive it. Think about it all on your own, then make the decision you think would be best for you.",1,0,2023-08-08 03:26:52 UTC,7,crimson_solace,15kluod,t3_15kluod,3797,False,False,maldives

11,jvhoges,"As a rule other than ivf for selecting a non thalassaemia embryo, you can at the same time test for other genetic abnormalities 

Even if you're not both carriers, you can also do a blood test called the NIPT which allows you to screen for things like downs syndrome and other trisomys. In this day and age, there is no need to put yourself and a child through the challenges of a significant medical diagnosis.",1,1,2023-08-09 20:23:27 UTC,6,drhussa,15kluod,t1_jv959n4,411,False,False,maldives
12,jviurn1,"I am all for selecting a non thalaseamic embryo via ivf screening. But as of now that is not something easily accessible for everyone in the similar way say just screening for thalassemia is.

And you have honestly highlighted my major issue. There are many other things that are passed genetically and can be screened for. But you rarely if ever hear someone saying about screening for those (yes I know you just did). There definitely isn't a systematic mandate in place to screen for anything other than thalassemia. And you certainly don't hear about people breaking up because they might pass on other genetic issues. It's only thalassemia that seems to be this significant medical diagnosis that is a cruel burden on the children. And that creates a very bad and untruthful impression about thalassemic patients on the general public as well on the patients themselves.

And while I am fully for screening embryos and choosing the best one, where does genetic screening when choosing partners lead? There are so many genetic conditions. Are we going to say some are ok and others are not? What someone thinks as significant will also differ from person to person. Are we going to avoid everything? At that point we might as well just upload our dna profiles and make matches based on just that. With no regard for actual compatibility when it comes to all of the other things that actually matter to making a good family. And you're ultimately even going to have people who can't even find a partner because they have bad genes.

16,jvk0wpf,"Yeah they have :). While I understand that may not always be the case on the part of the family, the truth is thalassemia is something with proper treatment you can live an absolutely normal life. You can literally do anything else anyone else can. This is not the case for all other congenital illnesses. Yet somehow it has become the poster child for what to avoid at all costs.

And don't get me wrong I am not like saying yeah it's perfectly fine and no problem at all to be a thalassemic, of course there are issues. I would rather not take treatment as well. But at the end of the day I do firmly believe having a strong and supportive family environment is the most important thing for any child, whether thalassemic or not.
