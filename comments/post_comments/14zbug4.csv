0,jrxcb5i,"As anywhere in the world, I guess you can always make new friends while networking for work related things, or school related stuff if you're a younger. Ask people you know in your field of work for for a tea/coffee or just hangout in general. Avoid talking politics first and things you don't have in common.  Have conversations about things you like, TV shows, music or fishing. People who share some common interest as you will start to hang out more often. Or sometimes, people with different opinions sometimes would like to know the other side more. 

I'm assuming you're young. As you grow older you'll have different type of friends, people who used to hangout wont always be the same people who helps you out when you're in financial trouble, or loan you money when your kid is sick.

P.S: I saw your post in r/malaysia (another sub I'm in). I would recommend you to try, nasi lemak ayam redang, roti telur bawang or naan cheese if you're in a Mamak. Curry laksa and tom yam putih w/ rice is ok depending on where you buy. You can also get dim sum in some mamaks.",5,0,2023-07-14 12:16:12 UTC,1,z80lives,14zbug4,t3_14zbug4,1082,False,False,maldives

3,jrx8uuh,I don’t. Simple. Maybe it’s my own opinion but finding genuine friends at this time in age no matter how old u are is as hard as living a stable life in the capital if u get the context.

My longest friend is a guy I went to school with, he still lives in his island so we mostly keep in touch over text or when he visits Male'. My closest 2 friends are the ones I met when I was 16.  I made a few friends through work related things and from when I was pursuing higher studies. I generally meet 2-3 friends of mine on a more regular basis. We are all in our late 20s to early to mid 30s so we don't get to meet us as often.

11,jrxnkwy,"I don't think the process of making friends is any different whether it be a Maldivian, non-Maldivian, social, or non-social person. We have to put ourselves out there, and probably get hit by a lot of ""kaey gulhen ulhenee tha"" before we find someone that we like or are comfortable with. So, I don't think it's about choosing between Maldivians and non-Maldivians. It's just about finding people that you would enjoy hanging out with, and finding people like that takes trial and error. Sometimes, you might not like someone at first, but it doesn't hurt to give people a chance.
