Just a question: are these kind of resorts in demand? Are they booked all year long, or just some weeks in a year?",3,0,2021-01-17 09:26:49 UTC,1,Rodeobe,kz3ea1,t3_kz3ea1,162,False,True,maldives
1,gjliezn,"They're high in demand but mostly available year round just as long as you prebook your stay a couple months ahead. Also the normal villas range from $1000 to $2000 a night during the high seasons. They may even drop below $1000 per night during the low seasons.

The Waldorf Astoria Maldives has a private island that you can stay for yourself (by booking the entire island), if I'm not wrong, that is the island shown in the picture. I don't know much about how frequently people book that island. But it's extremely expensive and they provide equal amount of services to match that expense. 

Essentially you will have an entire island to yourself during the stay. You will have a private spa, restaurant, gym etc. You will be isolated from all the other staff and guests. Only the highest level of service will be available in that island. They also have a personal butler who will tend to you throughout your entire stay.


If you have additional questions, feel free to dm me. I'll try to help with what limited knowledge I have.",2,1,2021-01-17 15:12:33 UTC,0,Voidvicer,kz3ea1,t1_gjk7vmj,1035,False,False,maldives
