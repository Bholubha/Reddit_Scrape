0,ifylpyj,"Apparently, no one wants him in the Maldives except Mohamed Nasheed and few powerful figures who are close family friends of the Rajapaksa family.

Most likely, the average Maldivians don't want him either. What I notice a lot is, Maldivians tend to identify and be more sympathetic to Sri Lankan people than any other south asian nationality. So, I'm surprised Nasheed even thought of protecting Gotabaya.",11,0,2022-07-13 06:34:38 UTC,2,z80lives,vxufm4,t3_vxufm4,406,False,False,maldives

2,ifz408a,"Yeah. VERY disappointing to see the Maldives protect the corrupt clan.

The clan owns the people in Sri Lanka literally billions. Why the Maldives protect that corrupt clan beats me - even India and the USA said nope when the clan tried to flee to these countries. Maldives should reconsider and extradite the clan members that escaped to the country.",5,0,2022-07-13 10:39:23 UTC,0,shevy-ruby,vxufm4,t3_vxufm4,351,False,False,maldives
3,ig05xg9,"Iâ€™ve spoken to several people. Maldivian former President Mohamed Nasheed who once got ousted is now the parliament speaker. Got into the parliament with a few hundred votes and now pretends to be the prime minister of the country. Apparently, he overrode all security protocols and ordered SL president to enter into Maldives, carried him in a motorcade to a luxury resort. Maldivians cannot talk against this as Nasheed and the current president has criminalized expressing opinions against their foreign policy. Itâ€™s a shame how Maldivians refer to this nasheed character as the Mandela of Maldives ðŸ˜‚",6,0,2022-07-13 15:44:02 UTC,0,Head-Yak9607,vxufm4,t3_vxufm4,603,False,False,maldives

8,ihaj2w8,"None of us want him here. Itâ€™s a shame that it happened under our noses. It was all a plot from a failed president who thinks he has power in country where he has no support from the people. If Nasheed loved Gota so much he would have been smart to leave with him tbh. No Maldivian supports Nadheed, Gota, or anyone in this Govt. We stand with Sri Lanka.",1,0,2022-07-23 06:14:28 UTC,0,No_Emergency6305,vxufm4,t3_vxufm4,354,False,False,maldives

13,ifz456s,"Well, it is clear that there will be court cases against the whole clan as well as those who helped in stealing money from the people in Sri Lanka. So all who escaped to other countries have to be extradited.

I think he bought the rulers in Maldives via money from the people in Sri Lanka, which will be why he won't be extradited. Very shameful of the rulers in Maldives to benefit from this in their own private pockets. Now the people in the Maldives have an issue with corruption in their high ranks.",4,2,2022-07-13 10:41:01 UTC,0,shevy-ruby,vxufm4,t1_ifynw19,505,False,False,maldives
