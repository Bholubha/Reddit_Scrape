The best bit of visiting Maldives was that our resort did excursions to nearby island villages, and we'd get to walk around, see how everyday life looked, if only for a few hours.  We didn't enjoy how the resorts were sealed off from the rest of the country, and wanted to learn more.  Hopefully we can come back one day and spend more time in Mal√© and visit other towns.",kazmological,0,6

The book was published in 1993.",z80lives,0,4
