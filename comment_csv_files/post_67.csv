2,"A typical ""Dhivehi Aailaa"" (Maldivian Family) composition. Names in ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡» & ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.","Not sure if it's common in other islands, but in Addu and other parts of the south we also use Amaa along with Munnaa and Maaama for grandmothers. Quite funny because 'Amaa' is almost a derogatory term for Mother in Male dialect.

Never heard Maanbe though. I use Kaafage dhatha, Maama ge dhatha but most of the time just call them by their short name and dhatha, beybe suffix. (Like Mandhathaa, Hawwathaa, Aisa'thaa).

Offspring's are also still referred in genders. Dhiye for daughter fuh/futhaa for son is more common than ""dhari"", as was in Old Dhivehi. I don't know when Male dialect start to use gendering less frequent. I'm curious how many Nothern dialects still use it.

&#x200B;

BTW, Who's the 'owner'?

Edit: There's also kalo and kanlo to refer kids affectionately. Was wondering if that is used commonly in other islands?",z80lives,0,3

Our ancestors wouldn't have even tried to leave a legacy if they knew how much we would tarnish their way of life.

Dhivehi has no words for most of the things we need to talk about. I think we've all seen the recent cyber crime bill. It's entirely written using english words. It's an embarrassment to the language that we have to resort to it. 

Dhivehi needs to get with the times or it'll get left with the dust. We the new generation aren't gonna stay around with it just because of sentimentality. A language has to be practical first and foremost. :)",menixator,1,3

Enough people care to make a change. It's a shame you won't be part of it. Hope you realize it before it's too late.

We represent the ails and suffering of Generation Z. 

We bear them willingly and we'll fight for their rights as long as we hold breath. For they are the undeniable future.

12,"A typical ""Dhivehi Aailaa"" (Maldivian Family) composition. Names in ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡» & ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.","You do have a solid point about the lack of Dhivehi words in the context of Information, Communication and Technology (ICT). 

Be that as it may, looking at the Japanese language for an example, we see that almost all of the names of many electronic devices, peripherals, hardware and whatnot are literally the same as the words in English (pronounced with a touch of Japanese pronunciation of course). 

See this link for reference: https://ling-app.com/ja/technology-words-in-japanese/

With all due respect, I personally feel that this is not a problem faced by the Dhivehi language only, but many Asian languages as well. I do believe that people do tend to be a tad too critical and harsh on Dhivehi in this regard.

With that said, I do not see the Japanese language losing its relevance in the aforementioned context and do not see why Dhivehi should also become ""irrelevant"".

What are your thoughts on this?",Zestyclose-Speed-370,0,1
