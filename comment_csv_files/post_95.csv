1,Opinions about allowing freedom of religion here?,"I don't believe in expats making places of worship, but I do believe in freedom of religion for Maldives. Not everyone is muslim, and we must accept that, and respect that. Even from an islamic perspective, we are advised to be understanding and respectful. Like another comment mentioned, the state shouldn't have a say when it comes to religion. If your sense of faith is tied to complying with the state then is it really truly authentic? We all should be able to choose what we believe in and not have it shoved down our throats. 

Edit: According to Maldivian law, you have to be a muslim to be Maldivian. I also don't believe in that. If you're born here, and you got Maldivian parents, then you're Maldivian no matter what you choose to believe in. That's how I see it anyways.",CarelessNightingale,0,11

3,Opinions about allowing freedom of religion here?,"u/Maakanaa I think this is the most polarized thread I've seen recently in here üòÇ

Personally, I don't think state should ever be involved in religion.


Maldives is a monoethnic nation - like Malays of Malaysia - we seem to have infused cultural and religious identity. So I don't think state hold on religion will go away anytime soon.

We also have this religious nationalism formed not long ago and more recently a pan Islamic identity (btw, modern salafi movement also falls under Islamic modernism).

>What about allowing expats to construct places of worship?

Funny that's it's now a touchy subject for a lot of people. We had a chapel in Addu for the british and it was not that controversial back then.

It's important to improve the human rights and living conditions of the expats and freely practicing their own religion on their personal space is part of that. 

We probably should not let anyone build any type of public place for worshipping, just look at king salman mosque here in Mal√©.

7,Opinions about allowing freedom of religion here?,"I was recently discussing this with my family. In my opinion, if Maldives really is a democracy, there should be freedom of religion. I'd say our country is more similar to a religious theocracy now than an actual democracy. Freedom of religion is absolutely a human right. People should have the freedom to believe whatever they want to believe or even believe in nothing at all if they choose to. Otherwise, it's dishonest to call this a democratic country. 

It's up to the people to choose whether we want Sharia or Democracy. There's no middle ground between the 2 as they are completely different systems of governance.

8,Opinions about allowing freedom of religion here?,"If you go strictly by what the Quran says and what the prophet practiced, non-Muslims are explicitly allowed to practice their religion and they should not be persecuted. It just so happens that Muslim fanatics and leaders with  an intentionally narrow conservative mindset have changed this interpretation to create a hard stance about Islam when it‚Äôs actually all about peace and mercy!! 

And as long as these people in power stay in these high places of power influencing Muslims and non-Muslims with their bigotry; Islam will continue to get a bad name. 

And it‚Äôs not just about Islam, Hinduism is also going through this turmoil. Just look at what‚Äôs happening in India where far right Hindu fanatics have hijacked the Hindu religion and created a Jihadi version of it. 

Even in Christianity, the rise of intolerant right wing and far right practitioners has given rise to right wing dictators and politicians to power. 

Fortunately, the younger generation of Maldives are mostly liberal with a broad mindset so I feel this bad interpretation of Islam will eventually change when the old generation dies along with these bigoted mindsets.

27,Opinions about allowing freedom of religion here?,">It seems that the king then asked the whole country to convert into Islam. 
>Maldivian Islam seems to have that dictatorial flavour since origin. 

Yes, true but it's a myth that the whole country converted in 1153 when ""Dharumavantha"" (likely Sri Thirubhuvana Aditya) converted. We know from written evidence (e.g. Kudahuvadhoo loamaafaanu) that it took atleast a century to form a very syncretic version of local Islam. Scarce documents we have from the period shows that early form of Islam would be unrecognizable to a modern Maldivian. 

Since then over last 7 centuries a lot happened. Neither religion nor culture ever remained static. Islam like any other religion was a dictatorial tool at times, other times it was a tool used  by the lesser nobles and commoners to popularize and weaken the influence of the rulers. There were times Islam was used as an excuse to justify oppression and slavery, but there were also times when it was invoked for egalitarian purpose like ending oppression and slavery (e.g. King Moheydin and Chief Judge Tajjudin). Like any political tool, how religion is used depends on whomever is wielding it.

 Over the centuries we also had kings who tried to impose their version of Islam, Christianity or whatever version of 'Shariah' that was prevalent in that century. As you may know very few succeeded. Some killed their opposition, destroyed old mosques and defunct monastaries, rebuilt mosques that they deemed suitable. Take for example, Sri Rajeswaran(13thCE), Haji Hassan (15thCE) and Mohamed of Dhevadhoo (18thCE); all religious despots who used Islam as a tool but practiced entirely different forms of the faith that would contradict the others.

However, taking account of 800 years of written history very few rulers were actual theocrats. Majority of rulers operated by their own interest not out of spirituality or religion.


>Wasn‚Äôt the king then converted by Arabic traders etc to Islam

 This simplified explanation is likely the case for most of the muslim majority places in ""Maritime silk road"", but it's actually more complicated in each case. Also, often ""Arab traders"" were neither arab or not even muslim. Other than religious commodities such as charms, books and artifacts; designs, ideas and architecture from the middle east were exchanged during this period and Islam was just a part of it.

 As we know in Maldives, there were a lot of Sufi proselyters but earliest person we can date is from 13th century. We're  not exactly sure why most of the Vajrayana Buddhist cultures in this route converted to Islam, but there is a hypothesis[1] that it have more to do with the spells, charms and relics the 'Arab' traders were trading. There is also the fact that the religious practices were very much localized by caste or was exclusive to groups, so it fostered an environment for religious syncretism. Unlike parts of North East India and South East Asia, we are not entirely sure about how things were in the Maldives.

However the most likely motivation for adopting Islam in the Maldives may have been political or economic reasons. After all, one of the earliest written records from 12th century is actually property endowment and tax decrees issued by the kings. Based on these documents we know that there seem to have been a radical powershift within the existing system. Conversely, it could have been Islam that triggered this powershift rather than the other way around.

For example, Isdhoo loamaafaanu (~1193ce) by Sri Gagana Aditya documents the execution of monks who opposed the royal order to convert, destruction of their monastaries but then focusing more on abolition of old taxes imposed by previous non-muslim kings and dues for certain influential families.

59,Opinions about allowing freedom of religion here?,"""It seems that the king then asked the whole country to convert into Islam. Maldivian Islam seems to have that dictatorial flavour since origin.""

I disagree with this. In my opinion, even if we tolerated certain leaders, Maldives was never dictatorial in its essence. And certainly not in terms of religion. Our leaders were always good to their people, even if they were despots and sometimes despised their immediate family. But I think Islam and the power it held in politics was certainly the prominent narrative at the time of Iskandar III when the first constitution was written. The Maldivian identified first as a Muslim. Go ahead and read any speech given in public for the last 50 years.  I think the issue is more complex when it comes to sovereignty.

There's a dialogue here posted by the OP and I was referring to that. And I wasn't making a point against you. But expressly agree with you. History itself is not questionable but historians and their perspectives. And who's to say that there wasn't support for the conversion? The reason that it took many years only goes to show that there was a lot happening. And even if the population converted fearing reprisals, why is this harsher than when the Mayan villages were wiped out by the Spanish? And if we had mass killings there must be mass graves. Besides there was very little incentive to force anything on Maldivians. If Bell's descriptions were right, we are gullible people easily swayed (although fiercely nationalistic) up until we found our footing in more modern times. I would say specifically around Nasir's rule.

The 'historical context' (800 plus years) that I referred to was in terms of sovereignty, nothing else. This debate is about a point in our constitution. But consider this, we haven't had the death sentence in our country except in one previous case and now once again recently If I'm not mistaken. It has never been carried out in modern times. I think that's a sign of cautiousness. And when it comes to letting people practice out in the open we should at least consider our identity,  in spite of history. 'You cut off a people from their history and you cut off their roots.'

It's not just the case of Sanyal, but a few more Indian writers, who wish to have a more central, India-dominant narrative with account to history for the benefit of their technocrat class (I actually think Sanjeev Sanyal has a better grasp of Indian Ocean Histories than most).  And I see no problem with that. They are struggling with the same issues and the current government is aggressively Hindu (India still is very much caste-based by the way, you can see that even in their writing).  And don't even get me started on the bourgeoise classes (still existing) in the West, in spite of the views and warnings of philosophers such as Chomsky, and theorists like Gladwell and Alain de Botton. And the self-made techno-elite (Bill Gates).It's fine to apply modernist thinking from the comfort of a cushioned bed, but let's not forget, there are two main narratives in Maldives. That of an  'elite landowner class', who think that they should be able to enjoy the pleasures of a more hedonistic lifestyle. Even if that means controlling their landowner status at the cost of social unrest. And that of the more common person, who still identifies with their culture and the need to make ends meet. When it comes to the institutions and laws, I think it's better left to the latter. And that in theory is the state. Our state as far as the law rules until now, is one religion. And in a country as small as Maldives, I think that's a good thing (that is my opinion, in spite of coming across as being sarcastic, which I'm not irl). I also think it's a good thing that we are open to creating more opportunities and jobs, and a healthier expat community. And no, I don't think it's a good thing that we take advantage of them. But when it comes to 'allowing' other religions. That's a technicality in the law. Nobody is forcing Islam on others in the Maldives (unlike what some people here think). If you identify as non-muslim. That's your concern. But as per law, yes. You can't be a non-Muslim and be a Maldivian. That can only be changed by law right now. And even if that is changed in my opinion right now one religion is what will work in the Maldives. I can be proven wrong. But I don't see it yet.",Sh4uki,2,4

(I'm happy someone took time to write a reply)  I already got that you were not making a point against me, I was adding my own opinon to your post. You probably want this conversation with OP not me. I was pretty much making the point against the claim that religion was only a ""dictatorial tool"" narrative, so this whole reply seems a bit moot.  

Tldr, of my post was most rulers used religion for their own person benefit. Also, Islam was adopted slowly over a century, with small scale social changes not with mass violence within 10 years. I'm not sure if you're understanding my post, it doesn't have any subtext. We probably should make a different thread to have your conversation as it's getting off topic.


>was certainly the prominent narrative at the time of Iskandar III

We don't call him Iskandar III, that's not his name and we also don't number our sultans like the British. Sultan Shamsuddin Iskander III is the third king with Shamsuddin name. First was the foreign king, other uncle of dhon bandaara who built kallhu vakaru miskiy and then him. Maldivian sultan's reignal name usually have an identifier to distinguish other than the biruda and full arabic title we get. For example, Dhiyamigili Ibrahim rasgefaanu would be Ibrahim Iskander II and only Iskander rasgefaanu in any context would mean Utheemi Ibrahim Iskander I. Imadduddin II, III and IV is known to Maldivians by 'Muzaffar', 'Mukarram' and 'Muskulhi' prefix other than their local names. 

P.S I guess we have similar political leanings.

68,Opinions about allowing freedom of religion here?,"It's not what you or I think. Sufi Qadiriyya sect like other religious minorities were persecuted. Tajuddin writes about it and he was a member of the sect. Earlier Iskander rasgefaanu kicked the Qadiriyya sects out of Maldives. They came back while his wife Mariyam was the regent, plot against her. Moheyddin brought back his a'lim who was briefly installed as a king.

 Then triggered the period where the ulema practically ruled Maldives and it was almost theocracy. Look at all the reforms made during this period, especially by Dhevadhoo rasgefaanu. A lot of radical social reforms were issued. He also rebuilt a lot of mosques, take a look at kuda huvadhoo mosque contrast between parts of the surviving portion of the old entrance and wall. 

Other than that we had a lot of religious turmoil, the whole war between the goan portuguese, their collaboraters and Utheemu brothers is explicitly described as a religious conflict by Tajuddin himself in Tarikh. In fact first two section of the manuscript is a political and religious treatise.

'Tarikh' is also filled with instances of executions by drowning, burning and beheadings all for different reasons; political, religious or just pissing of the king. There were a lot of treason, scheming and backstabbing  going on, that is hard to summarize in a reddit post. My point is past was not a serene time as some depict, lower class of the society had a harder time surviving.

Islam in my opinion is a just a way of life - to be a nice ethical person. And that‚Äôs about it.

All the other things muslim do are just rituals that many devout Muslims indulge it; not mandatory things the Quran asks you to do. 

Of course there are bad things in Quran but we have to apply common sense and see it from the historical time and society of those days when it was imposed upon.

I don‚Äôt prescribe to what conservative and ignorant hard stance Muslim preachers and extreme leaders preach or dictate how a Muslim should live their life.

Infact a swedish theologian called WikiIslam an Islamophobic web portal with stories **selected** only to show that Muslims are ""ignorant, backward or even stupid""

93,Opinions about allowing freedom of religion here?,"Why? Why should I adhere to any ideals when the Quran is clear enough to guide you? And there is no reason to turn atheist or agnostic to realize this. 

There is no concepts of Shia or Sunni in the Quran. Sunni and Shia were/are just political creations after the Prophet‚Äôs death in the wild struggle for political power in his absence. In the quest to legitimize and claim one was better over the other - rituals, narratives, morals and selective interpretations were ideated and created. After all, religion is a powerful opium to unite and control mass populations. As if the violent genocidal Crusades are testimony to this, the Second World War and the sectarian and communal strifes since then across the world is enough testimony how religion can be used to spread hate, violence, intolerance and bigotry.  

In its truest essence, Sufism is perhaps the best way to embrace Islam but unfortunately, it‚Äôs given a mystical Rastafarian tone while Sunnis and Shias want to outdo each other as the best version of Islam ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. In the meantime,  anti-Muslims and ignorant ex-Muslims stigmatize it as a violent religion that‚Äôs more interested in the rewards of the afterlife than the current life. 

If more Muslims and Non Muslims read and re-read the Quran in its entirety and also spend time reading its different interpretations by different authors/theologians/ex-Muslims/new Muslims; you‚Äôll get the realization that it‚Äôs a unnecessarily maligned religion and I am pretty sure, not what God wanted to tell. 

I have also read the Bible (both the new and old) and it‚Äôs many interpretations, the Torah and also the Vedas and Bhagwad Gita of Hinduism and I believe all of them preach the secular oneness of god ultimately and preach elementary advice - that to be a good person and live an ethical altruistic kind happy life.
