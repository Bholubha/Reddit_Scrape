0,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Some of the games I like are very old, from PS1. I like harvest moon back to nature, digimon world 1, 2 and 3 plus digimon card battle, which are all ps1 games, but my fav digimon game is digimon world next order. I like turn based games too like civ games and ff games, especially ff8 but ff15 is my fav game in the ff series. While I'm on ff, I should say I didn't play all the ff games and would like to mention I liked dissidia too. I don't particularly like God of war but still a good game that I did enjoy. I like dmc too, haven't played dmc 1 and 5 yet, 3 has been my fav so far. Also I like the assassin's Creed games, playing unity now and I actually played all the main assassin's Creed games up to unity. For mobile games, the online games I play are mobile legends bang bang and coc, for an offline game I play an indie game called world rumble. Also would like to mention mount and blade 2: bannerlord, while I'm not particularly good in this game I do enjoy it. I did play dark souls but didn't finish it, I would maybe finish them in the future but for now I have other games I want to try more. I also like games like red alert, Warhammer 40k dawn of war, age of empires. For red alert, I liked red alert 2 Yuri's revenge the best and for age of empires, I liked 2 best.

Now there are definitely some games I'm forgetting here. I mostly like single player games with a good story. I don't really like multiplayer games, especially battle royale games.",ProfOfIllogicalLogic,7,6
1,Video game nerds of Maldives,"GTA SA , Skyrim . More story driven games multiplayer games for me. I was skeptical but i enjoy breathe of the wild a lot too .",kiru_haluvaa,8,5
2,Video game nerds of Maldives,"So many games. Dead space remake for horror genre, GTA 5 for open world sandbox genre, God of war 3 for action genre.

The best game I've played recently was final fantasy 16. Finished it 3 days ago. On my new game plus walkthrough now.",Real_Mousse_3566,3,3
3,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Mainly a PC gamer but I do game on PS also.

All time favorite: Knights of the Old Republic! Off the top of my head, listing in no particular order the games I enjoyed the most include: Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Disco Elysium, Fallout, Divinity (yes I‚Äôm an RPG fan ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)), Dota 2, God of War, Assassin‚Äôs Creed. Hogwarts Legacy was fun too. Currently playing Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3. Waiting for Starfield next month.

9,Video game nerds of Maldives,"I haven't played video game more recently, but I used to play a lot. Most of them are a bit older, but I hope you'll enjoy them. I'll list down 10 games that has good replay value.

1. Final Fantasy VI
2. The Sims
3. Mass effect series (- not Andromeda, that's garbage)
4. Super Metroid
5. Castlevania 
6. Fire Emblem any of the GBA games
7. Mother / Earthbound series.
8. Tetris
9. X-Com
10. Elder Scrolls (any game in this series holds up)

I picked ff6, because I played all final fantasy titles progressively till 10 and it is really the best one. Along with Chrono Trigger, Earthbound and Lufia II it's probably the best jrpg of it's time. 

Mass effect, because it has a decent story and good space opera. 

Castlevania and Metroid, has the best gameplay ever designed. Discovered Super Metroid when I wrote a paper on it (about symbolism and narrative) for college assignment (also portal and ""To the moon""), it has a good replay value. 

Fire Emblem; I played to pass time when commuting.
X-COM and battle toad whenever I wanted something challenging, I hate contra and metal slug is way easy.

Tetris, hard to believe for some but probably the best game ever made. I used to write tetris and snake in every new language, emulator or platform I work on. Even wrote one for ""z80lives"", my old partially complete but abandoned z80 based computer emulator suite.  Ironically it's name ""lives"" on as my internet handle.

Also, shout out to cool rpg maker games like, Undertale, Lisa, Yume Nikki and Corpse party.",z80lives,2,2
10,Video game nerds of Maldives,"All time favourite game is Bloodborne. Made me appreciate how good video games can be, after a long time. Love Hollow Knight too for similar reasons. I've enjoyed all the Fromsoft games I've played. I like dabbling in Monster Hunter too, last one being World. Somehow stopped playing after reaching HR. Planning to go back to it, but haven't worked out yet. Last game I finished is God of War Ragnarok. Was decent fun. Currently just starting out FF16. Oh, and Dave the Diver just to chill when I have a few minutes to spare.",katsuwonis,4,2

15,Video game nerds of Maldives,"My favourite game developer so far is From Software.
Especially Starting from Demons Souls back in 09 every game they released so far has been really enjoyable to play. Bloodborne is my personal favourite video game of all time.

Other series i really like are Uncharted and Gow of war. 

Additionally; 

Liked GTA Sa and GTA 3 ( 4 and 5 not so much lol )

RDR 2 is a masterpiece  ( haven't played 1 )

FF16 and FF7 are excellent as well

Assassin's Creed ( up to syndicate. haven't played anything after that )

Resident Evil (all the recent ones)

Ghost of Tsushima

TLOU 1 ( 2 is utter trash btw )

Dmc ( every main entry apart from dmc 2 is really good)

Prince of Persia sands of time and warrior within ( ahh the nostalgia, really wish Ubisoft would remake these 2 )

Tomb Raider Trilogy",Ok_Department_8915,1,1

18,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Age of Empires 2 and Red Alert 2... 

Was checking for these two. Still two games that cannot be forgotten .  Played Age of empires for the first time on a trial edition that came with Windows 98. 

Apart from those two.

Sega: Mortal Kombat 1-3, lion kings PC:  Commandos 1&2 ,Generals, Counter-Strike, prince of Persia 2, duke nukem 3D,Gran Turismo, need for speed from 1 upto  Most Wanted(2005), Unreal tournament,diablo 1&2, neverwinter nights 1&2. Tom Clancy's Ghost recon.",bonbenzo,4,5
19,Video game nerds of Maldives,"digimon world was the shit back then. I think I played 2 and 3 the most along with card battle!

 I am a fan of turn based gamed too, really enjoyed persona 5 when it blew me away even though its a turn based game + life simulator lol. The only thing to look out for in DMC1 is underwater combat idk why but whenever there's underwater combat in a video game I just go meh. Ff8 was really nice too I am probably going to play FF9 soon and then go back to FF8.

dark souls I played 3 but I played it so brain dead that I had no idea what I was doing. I was just killing things
 
and agreed I am not a fan of battle royal games either though I do enjoy multiplayer games like monster hunter",burgerman000,1,1
20,Video game nerds of Maldives,I tried to get into breath of the wild but I couldn't get into it at the time. Too bad there isn't one for the ps since I don't own a switch and used to borrow my uncles,burgerman000,7,3
21,Video game nerds of Maldives,Good taste in games and max respect for liking Dead Space. That game scared the shiz out of me back then. FF16 is definitely on my list.,Grobyx,1,2
22,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Dead Space is soo good. I can't wait to try the remake. Just I can't seem to find the time cause of work and things and ofc playing other games 
Been playing final fantasy 16 and I've reached Bahamut. Pretty epic game tbh",burgerman000,0,1
23,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Oh star wars fan? 
I played Mass Effect 3 and Andromeda. Thinking of buying the Mass Effect Trilogy on sale on the ps. I also played Dragon Age Inquisition I really enjoyed the gameplay. God of War oof I remember that I still haven't finished Ragnarok. Assassins Creed I played the 2 Trilogy, 3 and then 4. Was wondering if I should play the rest? Hogwarts Legacy wasn't the let down I thought it was going to be tbh. Did you play Diablo IV? 

I don't have steam. but I don't mind adding you on psn or discord",burgerman000,2,2
24,Video game nerds of Maldives,I tried to get into skyrim few years ago and I got do lost after killing maybe 2 dragons I think. Sometimes open world games end up overwhelming me lol,burgerman000,0,1

28,Video game nerds of Maldives,which ones have you played?,burgerman000,0,1
29,Video game nerds of Maldives,"I am actually planning on playing all the older final fantasies. I've only done 3 before other than that I played from 7 til 16. Only final fantasy that I haven't played  among the new ones are the 7 reunion and 13-3

haha I hear andromeda is garbage but for some reason I didn't hate it as much but then again I can have weird tastes but I do also plan on getting the mass effect Trilogy as well.

Tetris is always bae tbh

Xcom is a strategy game? or am I thinking of something else?

alot of the times I just can't seem to find the time to play games like i used to! it's sad ngl",burgerman000,1,2
30,Video game nerds of Maldives,"I was so brain dead when I played bloodbourne when it first came out. Legit just fought everyone and killed anyone üòÖ the only Fromsoft game I didn't properly play was aside from DS1 and DS2 is Sekiro. Going to muster the courage and skill to play it sometime soon. 

I hadn't finished Ragnarok or Ff16 even though I played both. What's dave the diver though? Also if you want to play monster hunter we can play it together I got both games on the ps",burgerman000,3,2
31,Video game nerds of Maldives,"MC be the GOAT

do you play bedrock?",burgerman000,1,1
32,Video game nerds of Maldives,do you think they'll make a second or they'll just make a new game with the same gameplay,burgerman000,1,1
33,Video game nerds of Maldives,"I think the last need for speed i played was rivals. THINK im just spoiled with how much I enjoyed most wanted so I didn't play the upcoming ones 

Sekiro is great but I was a too much of a wimp to keep pushing forward. Thinking of replaying it this year tho, probs gonna stream to my friends so they can laugh at my horrible gameplay lol 

Ghost of Tsushima was great. Can you imagine that a knew guy who said sekiro and ghost are similar",burgerman000,0,1
34,Video game nerds of Maldives,Oh can't forget Nier: Automata lol,Ok_Department_8915,0,1
35,Video game nerds of Maldives,I love red alert 2. That was my childhood ngl  that and playing the pokemon games on an emulator and ofc mortal kombat! I'm really excited for the new one,burgerman000,0,2
36,Video game nerds of Maldives,U play online for AoE2 or RA2?,Advanced-Classic92,1,1
37,Video game nerds of Maldives,"I played Rise of Nations which is kind of similar to AoE2 and RA2, ever heard of it?",BasyaAviation,0,1
38,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Digimon world next order is just like digimon world. But instead of one digimon, two follow you around. You can even DDNA digivole them temporarily. It's one of those games that makes you think they made an improvement on the old one. Also the character we play in digimon world makes an appearance as a npc in next order.

I hated world 2's music. It literally makes me sleepy. I know this cuz I tested with sound on and sound off plays but still played it a lot lol. Card battle I did get a 100% completion. I probably played world 3 the most but for the mini card game in it, that was a game on it's own.

I don't think there's much to say about ff. The whole series is very well made and all people now need to do is just pick their favorites. I liked how ff8 had the junction functions. Persona 5 was recommended to me but I haven't gotten around to playing it.

Oh, and before I forget, I really dislike games with gacha systems too. For example genshin impact. I will agree that the gameplay and story is really good, the gacha system and the heavy reliance on luck is a big turn down to me.",ProfOfIllogicalLogic,0,1
39,Video game nerds of Maldives,Lol i honestly finished really few games. . Still have not completed last of us. So one issue i have in this maldives is internet. Games take 100s of gb‚Äôs. So im forced to download compressed repacks.,kiru_haluvaa,6,2
40,Video game nerds of Maldives,Oh yeah Dead Space got me good too when it first came out. Haven't gotten to the remake yet but its on my list,burgerman000,0,2
41,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Oh yeah, huge Star Wars fan. The legendary edition of Mass Effect is definitely worth picking up. Andromeda can‚Äôt even hold a candle to the original series‚Äô storyline. Way more epic and grand. 

As for AC, 2 was easily my fav. But I loved Origins as well. Bayek, the main character, was something else and his story was very compelling and a rollercoaster of emotions such as anger at his enemies, grief for his predicament. A really well-written storyline. Odyssey and Valhalla were also good, both in terms of story and gameplay but mainly if you‚Äôre into history, mythologies and stuff and a lot of combat. 


Yep, I‚Äôve finished the main campaign for Diablo 4 (Rogue, flurry build) but haven‚Äôt made much progress on the new season with my new character. Around lvl 16 or so. Between work and family duties, really hard to play for hours on end like the old days.",Grobyx,1,3

44,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Yeah, as you grow older time goes faster.   


X-COM is turn based strategy. It has permadeath and a brutal AI that learns and adapts on your gameplay. A good game to torture yourself. If you never played it before, you should play the newer and more accessible remakes - X-COM: Enemy Unknown and it's sequel X-COM 2.",z80lives,0,1
45,Video game nerds of Maldives,"That's one way to go through Bloodborne, haha I'm sure I did my fair share of stupid things in my first playthrough as well. You should definitely give Sekiro another go. When it clicks, it's so satisfying. Wouldn't say there's a skill requirement, just need to get used to the system. 

Dave the Diver is an indie game that came out recently. You dive, catch fish, make sushi etc. Pretty fun. Great pixel art too. 

I might hit you up on that MH invite. None of my friends play. I played on PC, but have it on ps too. Haven't progressed much in ps, so probably gonna boring for you to play together right now, since I'll be starting out.",katsuwonis,2,2

...then again, they made a game called Bloodborne",Bykadelik,0,1

49,Video game nerds of Maldives,Oh you play on the pc? yeah the Internet issue gets in my way too. I have friends who want to play multiple games but I can't cycle through them cause I gotta delete some to get new ones and I also share the console with my sisters so Internet being meh in Maldives is annoying,burgerman000,5,2
50,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Same I do love myself some star wars though I haven't played the new star wars games 

Tbh when I first tried AC2 back on the ps3 I didn't like it. Decided to replay it on the ps4 back on 2018 or something and thought it was okay but then when i played Assassins Creed Brotherhood I was completely hooked to the series, just from beginning to end I really enjoyed all of it

I got diablo IV yesterday and gotten only a few hours in. But yeah between work and things I can't really play for hours like I used to",burgerman000,0,2

52,Video game nerds of Maldives,OOOF,burgerman000,0,1
53,Video game nerds of Maldives,"I even balanced out all of my points on my character cause I wanted to look neat,  either that or I put my points into whatever stat that made me wear more things. Honestly didn't realise they scaled with my weapons until LIKE....after I finished played both ds3 and bloodbourne! apparently you can be pure stupid and still beat both their base games. I am looking forward to playing sekiro again tbh, might even play bloodbourne and ds3 as well just cause

Actually yeah go ahead and hit me up for MH! it's not really boring for me even if we do the lower tier ones! I'm completely fine with the journey.

my psn is laughinkoffin",burgerman000,1,3
54,Video game nerds of Maldives,Yeah PC. So what do you play? You know how some people are really into jrpgs like final fantasy and Bayonetta. I was never drawn to them. I liked ‚Äúwestern‚Äù themes more. Then i tried breathe of the wild and i loved it.,Maakanaa,4,3
55,Video game nerds of Maldives,Sweet. I'll add you.,katsuwonis,0,2
56,Video game nerds of Maldives,"I play different genres of different themes tbh

I played alot of Final Fantasy, devil may cry, Resident Evil, Uncharted, Monster Hunter, Destiny 2, spiderman...the list goes on! you can ask me if I played something that you like!! I would've played breathe of the wild more if it was on the ps though. Does this mean you got the new Zelda game ?",burgerman000,3,3
57,Video game nerds of Maldives,I want to give jrpgs a chance. What should i play? Currently playing metal gear solid. I would when i am done with it.,Maakanaa,2,3
58,Video game nerds of Maldives,"Metal Gear Solid was also another game I couldn't get into but then again I was very young when the hype for It was at its peak. Back then I wasn't really into stealth genres. NGL I thought I'd never get into Assassins Creed Back then too but ended up getting into it when I played Batman Arkham Trilogy and was like ""guess I can do it if I actually want to""

As for JRPGs I'm guessing you want an action one instead of the stereotypical turn based ones",burgerman000,1,2
59,Video game nerds of Maldives,"I would recommend nier:automata or persona 5 royal if u dislike Final fantasy

Not strictly JRPGs ( but could be tbf ) - Souls Games (  Bloodborne, Dark Souls, Sekiro, Elden Ring )",Ok_Department_8915,0,1
