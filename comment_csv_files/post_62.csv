3,Chase a baby shark,"Only baby sharks enter the lagoon shallows. Even otherwise, we Maldivian don’t know sharks like movie Jaws have us believe. They’re docile and only mind their own business. The only time we hate them is when they bite off a half of the fish we caught on a drop line, while being pulled out of the water hehe",ZahirIbrahimZahir,1,8
