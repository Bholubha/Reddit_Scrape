0,Sihuru/Rugya is a multi million rufiya industry and we should be really worried!,"I've heard so many stories. There was this lady in my mom's island who used to ""go crazy"" according to them because apparently, she was supposedly ""possessed by a jinni"". It was only later that I realized this poor woman was probably having manic episodes, and people just assumed it was ""Jinni avalun"".  This was in the 90s. 

So many cases of people who were clearly mentally ill being mistaken for ""demonic possession."" Religious fanaticism is largely to blame.",bicchlasagna,0,14

4,Sihuru/Rugya is a multi million rufiya industry and we should be really worried!,"""We know that feeling jealous or envious can lead to¬†feelings of anxiety, worthlessness, and even acts of verbal or physical abuse. And it's not just the person feeling jealous whose psyche is damaged‚Äìit's the person who is the object of jealousy and envy, too""

Islam helps us both physically and mentally. What does not seems like an illness physically can be an illness on the mind. Ruqya helps us calm down and does not only correlate to jinn",Culture_D,2,2
5,Sihuru/Rugya is a multi million rufiya industry and we should be really worried!,"It's indeed a business but there are real ones. Like my cousin who was having panic attacks. We went to India for treatment cause no doctors here knew what was happening and they didn't find the cause either. We hired many therapists for him.  P. S:  he wasn't being bullied or anything either. 

Later a friend told his mom to try Ruqya,  we did and it worked. Don't cost more than 400 MVR.  Sihr is a real thing,  we need to be aware of but also need to understand not all things are associated with it. Consult the doctors first and if no lead is found try ruqya.",Culture_D,0,2
6,Sihuru/Rugya is a multi million rufiya industry and we should be really worried!,"I do believe that most of these occurences are most likely because of mental illness, but I do think some cases are genuine cases of posession. Like I mentioned in a previous comment, it's very difficult to differentiate between cases of actual posession and that of mental illness. When you're posessed you tend to see things that are not there and when you hallucinate it is the same. In both cases, your perception of reality is warped. However, in both cases, the fear, and the anxiety you experience are very much real. 

The wellness industry survives because for some people it works. Things like essential oils, alternative medicine, rugya, etc. I'm not saying anyone who has symptoms of mental illness should go and try these things, but when all other options have been exhausted, it is worth trying these methods. Scientifically, we lack research on a lot of these non-clinical practices, but some of them like meditation has been proven to bring positive effects. 

Edit: I do not agree with jumping to conclusions ofc. Just because someone seems ""posessed"" doesn't necessarily mean they are. It's important to try to solve things from a clinical perspective first.",CarelessNightingale,1,1

9,Sihuru/Rugya is a multi million rufiya industry and we should be really worried!,An aunt of mine is most likely schizophrenic but the entire family is convinced that her life long friend has done sihuru on her because the friend is jealous of my aunt‚Äôs success. They have consulted a rugya guy and he‚Äôs been laying a whole plot of how bad the sihuru is. When she‚Äôs having her episodes she acts ‚Äúpossessed‚Äù and the rugya kuraa guy literally beats her while reciting some nonsense. The worst part is my aunt believes it too and obviously through this course of ‚Äútreatment‚Äù she‚Äôs gotten even worse. This went on for months until her family went bankrupt trying to pay this guy.,heyonuvaane,1,8
