3,Maldives Tourism/Travel Questions 2021 Megathread,"Hi Faru,

 Probably overthinking this, but what is accepted as booking confirmation for the accomodation/resort at Border Control?

We have an itinerary outlining dates of our stay and an email from the resort confirming that they're expecting us. Does this suffice or is a formal confirmation from our travel agent required? It is a bank holiday in the UK tomorrow and the travel agent will reopen after our arrival.

Thank you",Blocoholi,1,2
4,Maldives Tourism/Travel Questions 2021 Megathread,"Thanks for this post! Do people wear masks on the local islands like Maafushi? Especially with the new variant being more transmissible.

We are staying in MalÃ© for 1 night before flying back to Denmark - do you know where we can do a PCR test, which is cheap in MalÃ©? The resort charge 130 USD per person, which I think is outrageous, as it should be free from the government..",TheBurningDude123,4,1

19,Maldives Tourism/Travel Questions 2021 Megathread,"Excellent question.   


A lot of packages have unlimited. I unfortunately cannot advise you on the cost for GB but the speed and bandwidth have no problem. I use a monthly paid plan for my use, I think the tourist packages would be different.   


Hotel staff are generally individuals so, basic human psychology works. My favorite guests are the ones who ask me about my day, my life and get to know me a bit. My least favourite guests are ones who just see me as someone to ask for services.",,4,4
20,Maldives Tourism/Travel Questions 2021 Megathread,"No official rules yet regarding India to Maldives. It's very important to check the individual guidelines for each country.

23,Maldives Tourism/Travel Questions 2021 Megathread,"People are advised to wear masks but it's not strictly enforced by law, I'd still advise you to wear a mask. 
As per the law yes, if you are positive for covid when you test during your stay, you have to be in a 14 day quarantine, at a government designated quarantine hotel. I've heard mixed thoughts about such places.
The PCR as of now costs anywhere from 50 - 60USD.",,1,1

Highly unlikely tho.",,3,2
25,Maldives Tourism/Travel Questions 2021 Megathread,"Mostly yes!   


Rarely, if an island is under monitoring status, then no. Monitoring means the island is under strict monitoring due to possible outbreak.   


Most islands are covid free and if the island has an outbreak, it's best to change your booking to another island anyway - if your booking is refundable.   


Most booking websites have a new Force Majeure policy that allows you to claim a refund if it's not possible to visit or stay due to COVID related reasons.",,0,1

When I was in high school, every year around April/May it would rain. I remember it vividly cause I'd be studying for mid year exams around that time. Recently, it's not like that.

30,Maldives Tourism/Travel Questions 2021 Megathread,"I do agree that is an outrageous price! Well, it is free for citizens of Maldives by the government but just by the sheer volume of tests that need to be done for tourists it has created a demand for private labs to start covid testing, so now the tourists get only the private labs covid testing, and I hear there is a lot of costs involved in this (the testing machine, the transferring of samples)   


Maafushi is a local island quite close to Male' and still it's 50 USD here, which is among the cheapest. It used to be 100 USD around this time last year when we first re opened our borders.   


Yes, you can give a call to Treetop Hospital at Hulhumale, or ADK Hospital in Male' however it would not be free. But definitely not 130!!   


Also the 72hr PCR rule only applies if you stayed at a local inhabited island such as Guraidhoo, Gulhi, Thulusdhoo, Thinadhoo, Maafushi, Ukulhas so on so forth but not if you have stayed at a private island resort. So if you're staying in Male for 1 night it breaks this rule - you can check with your hotel in Male' for more detailed particular information.",,3,1

44,Maldives Tourism/Travel Questions 2021 Megathread,"I just got a tip for $10 dollars and I am ELATED, beyond the moon. I think I'd be quite happy with a tip of anything between 5 and 20 dollars. I've heard of some of my friends getting outrageous tips, which I honestly could never accept but they work at luxury resorts so it's explained.

Some workers such as waiters and luggage handlers receive a lot of tips but in small amounts so they may not show much gratitude towards it but it really does add up for them.

Tipping is NOT customary in our culture and we do not expect it.  


As for the sim, I honestly do not know. You may browse the websites for the largest carriers here Dhiraagu and Ooredoo for the packages they offer. I suspect around 20 to 30 USD for a week or two.",,2,3

72 hours is the timing on a test upon exit only if you have stayed at a guest house (not resort).  So this doesnâ€™t apply to many folks. 

Keep in mind - US and other counties however require exit testing (right now itâ€™s 1 day prior to departure).  Doesnâ€™t have to be a PCR but read up on country specifics.",sealutt,0,1
