1,"Tourism & Hospitality workers of r/Maldives, what is the most disrespectful thing a tourist/ foreigner has done?","You get the garbage with the good anywhere. Racist remarks, calling us cockroaches(an Arab guest), spitting, and I was present when a friend was called a donkey f&$&&r, homo… mind you not really original. But yeah, some people are really colorful. On the flip side you do meet some amazing people as well. Really good, genuine human beings are rare, but they shine everywhere. I’ve had a manager warn his countryman in front of us for being aggressive towards his Maldivian peers. So while guests may be tolerated I guess companies would stay on the safe side.",Sh4uki,0,7
