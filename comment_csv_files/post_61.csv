1,Workplace withholding my wife's passport,"Unfortunately this is pretty common thing that happens to immigrant workers, not only in the Maldives, but Asia as a whole.

But as someone else mentioned, it is prohibited by the law so contact a law firm.",YoloSwaggins77,0,9

3,Workplace withholding my wife's passport,"We are sorry to hear that. Unfortunately this is a common practice but illegal. You should fight for it, try filing a case against them.",Frequent_Plane9734,0,1
4,Workplace withholding my wife's passport,"Not the right course of action.  She should contact the consulate office of her country of residence, after filing a police report.  The police report should reflect that her passport has been stolen.  

With the police report, she should obtain a new passport from the consulate of her home country.

If her home country is the United States, the hotel chain will very likely face serious legal consequences.  And her employer can expect a call from the United States Department of State.",theoryofdoom,2,4
5,Workplace withholding my wife's passport,"I second this. It’s high time that companies here learned this lesson the hard way. That said, sometimes the passport process does take a long time and front- line staff usually don’t have the whole picture. Still they should give her a solid answer. Edit: the expat section of immigration is in the process of moving their offices to hulhumale. A long and tedious process.",deck_16,1,3

Totally agree.  If this is going on with foreign workers, it's time to get Interpol involved.  The United States Department of State might do that anyway (if the OP's wife is American, and she tells her story).",theoryofdoom,0,1
