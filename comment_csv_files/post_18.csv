0,Recapping a recent trip to the maldives - this might be useful for first time travellers,Komandoo is sooooo under rated. I try to tell people about it but they always go to bigger name resorts. Glad you had the same experience we did. We got a couples massage when we arrived on the island and it was a fantastic start. Would highly recommend that also. The sunset excursion was also fantastic.,texaswelder_,0,4
1,Recapping a recent trip to the maldives - this might be useful for first time travellers,"Maafushi is the most crowded and overrated local island. There are awesome ones like Omadhoo or Thoddoo, but,of course, not even those will give you the resort experience.
On the other hand, they will give you an awesome insight in to local culture and some amazing natural beauty.",bl00regardqkaz00,0,1
