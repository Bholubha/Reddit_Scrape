13,Sick of resort stuff on here,"üíØ‚ÄºÔ∏è as a non Maldivian who really likes and respects Maldivian/Dhivehi language and culture, it‚Äôs honestly sad how the public image of the country is exclusionary towards the people who live there and it‚Äôs just reduced to scenery mostly",ImmortalShells,1,1

15,Sick of resort stuff on here,Anybody want to talk about politics and how our parties are all personality cults that run on the same core platforms? Wish we had a proper left or right political party here with their core values identified,azmblue,3,1

18,Sick of resort stuff on here,"How about topics like those stuff posted on MV crisis, the unsolved crime cases like rilwan, the controversial stuff our politicians do, the live footage of insane stuff people are doing in the male‚Äô region, upcoming presidential election, the topics spoken openly on Facebook but introverts like us cannot do the same there and instead come here to see if our fellow redditors have an opinion on it",dhym002,8,7

20,Sick of resort stuff on here,Really curious about how the whole party system even came about and how the level of craziness went from low to peak,dhym002,0,1
21,Sick of resort stuff on here,"to be fair, while I would appreciate more posts about things other than resorts, I don't think shutting down anything to do with resorts is the best way. let them be, but we should just talk about other topics by ourselves instead. it's not that there are too many resort posts, just that there isn't enough of anything else.",antheiakasra,1,8

26,Sick of resort stuff on here,"Resorts are overrated. And any discussion about the place after 1978 pretty much centers on three things. Politics, elitism and drugs. You should try discussing books or writers here and see how far you get.",Sh4uki,0,1
27,Sick of resort stuff on here,"It's totally true. But I don't think anything will change in the next 10 years. 

I call this current leadership generation the 'survivors generation'. These people will stop at nothing to get money and materials, and they will use their family and religion to justify their greed.

These are the people who had to 'fight' their siblings and everyone else to come out on top. 

I feel that this is the outcome of our grandparents and great grand parents pushing out kids at both ends of the year without really understanding what parenting is.",Familiar_Reality425,1,1
28,Sick of resort stuff on here,"I think there are a lot of things that will need to change before things get better in that sense.

For one thing let me talk about the general public for a moment. Even though we call ourselves a Republic I do not believe our collective consciousness has truly embraced or understood the idea of a Republic or a Democracy. 

And this is ingrained on a cultural level starting from the royalty and the psuedo democracy that replaced that with beyfulhun's. Let us take a look at our language for one thing. In democracies we have leaders, not rulers. But to us we have only verin. Verin is the word for rulers, leaders and even owners. I am the verimeeha of the property I own. I should not be the verimeeha of people I am meant to lead.

And this mentality can be seen when you really think about it. We elect people, but then have this expectation that if the president/minister etc wants something to happen that should happen. That if you have a problem they should immediately be able to fix it by telling people to do so. And are upset when that does not happen. But that's not how democracies or leaderships work. That is how rulers rule. 

And then we have all these councils and commissions, where by law the president of such does not have an exceedingly great authority over the rest of its members. They are meant to work as a group, with the president leading and been the focal point. But what ends up is this culture of verimeeha makes the whole thing into whatever he/she wants happens. 

Ofcourse I do not really believe this is the general public's fault. It's just our ingrained culture we have yet been unable to change.",crimson_solace,0,1

30,Sick of resort stuff on here,Is it really that taboo? They're pretty easy to get.,CarelessNightingale,1,1
31,Sick of resort stuff on here,"Well, since you want controversy, I'll just give my two cents on the Rilwan case. I'm just gonna say I don't think it is unsolved at all. I think cases with political influence tend to go this way. Most of our mainstream media channels are super polarized and pretty much just propagate political bullshit. Also, I noticed a lot of the articles have spelling mistakes, but tbh I get it, Dhivehi is super hard to type.",CarelessNightingale,0,6
32,Sick of resort stuff on here,I do like this idea. But it's hard to imagine a real conversation being carried out without personal bombardment. I think us maldivians are hard to educate. Even to talk about disagreements in a civil manner.,Familiar_Reality425,1,3
33,Sick of resort stuff on here,"Not related to his case or your post. Rilwan was part of the old Maldivian blogosphere. I didn't know his name back then, he was known by his pseudonym ""moyameeha"". I wasn't an active part of the community, I only found out his name years later after his disappearance. 

I think one of the first blog article I recall from him was one about how the justice system let's away pedophiles, abusers and rapists. Probably sometime around 2008. I think his old articles are still online.",z80lives,2,2

40,Sick of resort stuff on here,"In effect, we just have people who cry and keep crying whenever things go wrong, and all they do is talk about it till someone else fixes it.. 

Imagine we have a whole bunch of them filling out all the government top positions and also the top positions in private sectors. You can see that we don't move forward. We just TALK about moving forward.",Familiar_Reality425,0,1
41,Sick of resort stuff on here,"My uncle, and dad both were fishermen in their early youth. Moved to Male and gave it up. Uncle because his health failed him, (he died of lung cancer, smoked two packs daily). Uncle would go out any chance he could get on a small outrigger and once caught a Marlin that he had to lash to the boat. Both brothers were taught by my grandfather, who (according to them) would take out a canoe and use a handmade spear to fish, sometimes tying his feet to the boat and jumping after the fish. No engines, no big sails or equipment, no safety. Just by himself. He would fish this way close to the island, but sometimes would get way out, following a catch. Bear in mind this is way before the modern vessels came. When a friend later passed me the book ‚Äòthe old man and the sea,‚Äô I thought. Hey that‚Äôs about my Uncle.",Sh4uki,1,3
