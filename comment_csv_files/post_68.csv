0,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"Just got back from the Maldives… the online form must be done within 24 hours of flight arrival, not departure. It does state departure, but it expires 24 hours after you submit it, so if you do it 24 before departure, it will be expired by the time you get there. I recommend doing it in the airport whilst you wait to depart, that way it will definitely be valid.",jack172sp,3,2

5,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"I am going in December to Maldives and staying at 3 different islands:

* Dhiffushi (big island) (6 days)
* Dhiffushi Resort (small island) (5 days)
* Malé. (2 days)

I am:

* From Denmark
* Fully vaccinated

1 day before flying, I will do a PCR test.

According to these rules [here](https://covid19.health.gov.mv/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-criteria-for-permitting-tourist-arrivals/?c=0):

* PCR test 4 days prior arrival in Maldives
* PCR test 3 days before check-out of each guesthouse

So according to the above rules, then I need to do 3 PCR tests in total:

* 1 in Denmark
* 1 before check-out of the first hotel
* 1 before check-out of the second hotel

So for the few first days in the big [Dhiffushi island](https://www.google.dk/maps/place/Dhiffushi/@4.4419622,73.7114756,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b3f916d9c4395c5:0x89b05894a4ae0485!8m2!3d4.4401762!4d73.7132147) (first hotel), I'm covered by the PCR test from Denmark.
Before going to the second hotel I need to do another PCR test, but I can't find any information on where to do the PCR test on [Dhiffushi](https://www.google.dk/maps/place/Dhiffushi/@4.4419622,73.7114756,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b3f916d9c4395c5:0x89b05894a4ae0485!8m2!3d4.4401762!4d73.7132147).
Then at the resort I need to do the third PCR test before going to the last hotel in Malé before flying home.

Is this correct?
Does anyone know this, I would really appreciate the help!",TheBurningDude123,17,1

18,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"I found more new information on [the tourism site](https://tourism.gov.mv/en/circulars/update_on_travel_restriction_september_2021):

19,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"Hey! We ended up canceling our hotel in Dhiffushi Island and book on a private resort. We were not allowed to go to the water bungalow resort (Dhiffushi resort) if we visited a local island (the big Dhiffushi Island) prior our arrival in that resort.

It was more expensive, but our stay was wonderful and the resort on Dhiffushi (Meeru Island) was almost perfect. The only thing was that they tried to kick us out of our room 8 am, when the checkout was 12 pm.. 
I discussed alot with the staff and agreed checkout at 11 am.

Let me know if you have more questions!
I believe the Covid rules have changed since we were there, but I can share some experience.",TheBurningDude123,0,1
20,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"Hi,  
I will be also doing split stay in 3 islands (two of them public island and 1 will be private resort island).

From your comments, if I have understood correctly:

\- Split stay is allowed now.

\- The guesthouse/ resorts will be arranging all the formalities associated with split stay for you.

\- you dont need to do PCR test before moving from one island to another. Just need to make sure the islands are not under monitoring list. (in my case the local islands are Maafushi and Fulidhoo).  


Do let me know if you have found any contradictory info. I will be travelling there soon.",Jobrointhehouse,5,1
21,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"I think thats the list here below:

https://covid19.health.gov.mv/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-criteria-for-permitting-tourist-arrivals/?c=0",ogiakul,5,1
22,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"Hi buddy,

I have contacted the resort (Meeru Island Resort) and unfortunately they require the following:

* NO visiting of local island before coming to the private resort. If you go to a local island, you will NOT be allowed to enter the private island, even if you have a negative PCR test
* If you choose to stay at another resort before coming to the next resort, you must send them a negative PCR test 48 hours PRIOR arrival.


So you CANNOT do it in the following order:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Local island (they do not care if you have a negative PCR test result with you)
* Resort

You CAN do the following:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort
* Local island 

You CAN also do it like this:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort - take a PCR test 48 hours prior arrival at next resort 
* Resort 


About the split-stays: it's possible and the place you are staying will do the formalities, just inform them where you are going next. If you can do it, send them an email with this information before going to the Maldives.

I will advice you to contact the resort you are staying at and ask them about the restrictions they have. It seems like the resorts can make their own COVID restrictions..

When are you going?

Safe trip!",TheBurningDude123,4,1
23,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"I found that one too, but I can't find Dhiffushi on that list. However I found it on this list:

https://covid19.health.gov.mv/covid-19-vaccination-coverage/?c=0

But Dhiffushi doesn't seem to fulfill the criteria yet.. This is also confirmed by this site:

https://www.visitdhiffushi.com/

So until they fulfil paragraph 2, then I cannot go without PCR test.


**EDIT:**
I found this list, which is more up-to-date (21st of october 2021):

https://covid19.health.gov.mv/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-criteria-for-domestic-travel/?c=0

According the this list, they fulfill the criteria. This is confusing..",TheBurningDude123,4,1
24,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"Thanks a lot brother.  
Actually I am doing this: Local island 1 (Maafushi) --> Local island 2 (Fulidhoo) --> Atmosphere Kanifushi (Resort Island).

I informed the resort island while booking that i will be coming from local island. They acknowledged it and did not mention about any restriction. So i suppose they are okay with this. I will still drop them a detailed itinerary again just to be 100% sure before visiting Maldives.",Jobrointhehouse,3,1
25,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"AFAIK the vaccination campaign in the maldives is almost done and if you are going in December it will probably be complete. 

The most important is the PCR on entry, which you need to upload to the IMUGA form. If anything else is needed during your stay, the resort/hotel will take care of it and inform you. They are very professional and will handle that, so don't worry about that too much.",ogiakul,3,1
26,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"Explicitly ask them if they require a negative PCR test before arriving at their resort from a local island. Sometimes they misinform, because they assume you know all the restrictions..

May I ask if you're staying on a water bungalow or something different at the resort?",TheBurningDude123,2,1
27,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"I contacted the first hotel and PCR tests are currently not obligatory. I will try contacting the other two!

Also do you have any information on multi-island visiting? There is something about completing ""split-stays"" forms but I'm not sure if this is still something mandatory to fill out when staying on different islands. The last post I found about this was 7 months ago.",TheBurningDude123,2,1
28,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"Yes, i would need to take explicit confirmation. Thanks for the suggestion.  


I am actually staying only 1 night at the resort island, as i am low on budget. However, trip to maldives won't be complete without staying one night on a water bungalow, so yeah i will be staying in over-water bungalow there.",Jobrointhehouse,1,1
29,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"No, I was on one island / resort only, so no info on that. 

But as I said as you are fully vaccinated I wouldn't worry about that. If a PCR is needed for a situation the resort will take care of it, because they have the responsibility for their guests. 

For example we had to do a ""medical exit screening"" (5 min doctor visit, fever measuring) one day before leaving. We didn't even know about that, but the resort organized everything perfectly. 

Also some other guests needed a PCR for their home country or the airline they travel with. And also this was organized by the resort.

I was also a bit nervous as this was my first trip to the Maldives and the COVID requirements seemed complicated. But in the end, if you have the PCR and vaccination proof delivered in the IMUGA form correctly, nothing can go wrong.",ogiakul,1,1

31,Guide - Travelling to Maldives during COVID,"Sounds good. I asked the Ministry of Tourism regarding the split stay, they wrote the following:

""Split stay will be arranged by the hotel/resort you are staying. Both the hotel and resort will arrange the split stay and complete all the legalities. However if the island is under monitoring all movements will be stopped except arrivals and departures.  Please refer to the below link to view the islands which are under monitoring.
https://www.tourism.gov.mv/en/page/updates_on_the_covid_19_situation_in_the_maldives""

I am not sure if I need to inform the hotel/resort that I'm split staying. I will contact the hotel/resort and figure this out.",TheBurningDude123,0,1
