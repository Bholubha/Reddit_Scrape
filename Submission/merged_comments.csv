I call this current leadership generation the 'survivors generation'. These people will stop at nothing to get money and materials, and they will use their family and religion to justify their greed.

For one thing let me talk about the general public for a moment. Even though we call ourselves a Republic I do not believe our collective consciousness has truly embraced or understood the idea of a Republic or a Democracy. 

And this is ingrained on a cultural level starting from the royalty and the psuedo democracy that replaced that with beyfulhun's. Let us take a look at our language for one thing. In democracies we have leaders, not rulers. But to us we have only verin. Verin is the word for rulers, leaders and even owners. I am the verimeeha of the property I own. I should not be the verimeeha of people I am meant to lead.

And this mentality can be seen when you really think about it. We elect people, but then have this expectation that if the president/minister etc wants something to happen that should happen. That if you have a problem they should immediately be able to fix it by telling people to do so. And are upset when that does not happen. But that's not how democracies or leaderships work. That is how rulers rule. 

And then we have all these councils and commissions, where by law the president of such does not have an exceedingly great authority over the rest of its members. They are meant to work as a group, with the president leading and been the focal point. But what ends up is this culture of verimeeha makes the whole thing into whatever he/she wants happens. 

Ofcourse I do not really believe this is the general public's fault. It's just our ingrained culture we have yet been unable to change.",1,1,2023-07-15 17:33:04 UTC,0,crimson_solace,14z6nnb

Recently tried KFZ- korean food zone  at hulhumale.  It is run by a Korean lady. Cute personality and creates the vibe and feel of a Korean place. And the food is authentic  . Thou might be just slightly a little high end on the pricing. It is worth for the experience.


As for symphony and  Italian dishes. Hmmm well they are too Maldivianized. At this point.  Yeah I understand cannot serve most Italian dishes due to halal. But can keep to the concept the theme of the original dish. 
For instance carbonara base of the dish is 
- Cured pork cheeks /pancetta 
- egg/egg yolks 
- parmesan/ pecorino

So why not just replace the cured meat with a halal beef based cured meat. Still this will not change the base of the dish. Which is even a served variant  in Italy to ppl who eat halal.

But here mostly it's take aways the eggs. Adds cream/ milk, Bell pepper. Cheddar cheese. Cream cheese parsley leafs . It is all a mushy mess.

Also I like the assassin's Creed games, playing unity now and I actually played all the main assassin's Creed games up to unity.

9,9,jv2rjoq,"I haven't played video game more recently, but I used to play a lot. Most of them are a bit older, but I hope you'll enjoy them. I'll list down 10 games that has good replay value.

1. Final Fantasy VI
2. The Sims
3. Mass effect series (- not Andromeda, that's garbage)
4. Super Metroid
5. Castlevania 
6. Fire Emblem any of the GBA games
7. Mother / Earthbound series.
8. Tetris
9. X-Com
10. Elder Scrolls (any game in this series holds up)

I picked ff6, because I played all final fantasy titles progressively till 10 and it is really the best one. Along with Chrono Trigger, Earthbound and Lufia II it's probably the best jrpg of it's time. 

Mass effect, because it has a decent story and good space opera. 

Castlevania and Metroid, has the best gameplay ever designed. Discovered Super Metroid when I wrote a paper on it (about symbolism and narrative) for college assignment (also portal and ""To the moon""), it has a good replay value. 

Fire Emblem; I played to pass time when commuting.
X-COM and battle toad whenever I wanted something challenging, I hate contra and metal slug is way easy.

Tetris, hard to believe for some but probably the best game ever made. I used to write tetris and snake in every new language, emulator or platform I work on. Even wrote one for ""z80lives"", my old partially complete but abandoned z80 based computer emulator suite.  Ironically it's name ""lives"" on as my internet handle.

Resident Evil (all the recent ones)

Ghost of Tsushima

Maldives is a monoethnic nation - like Malays of Malaysia - we seem to have infused cultural and religious identity. So I don't think state hold on religion will go away anytime soon.

We also have this religious nationalism formed not long ago and more recently a pan Islamic identity (btw, modern salafi movement also falls under Islamic modernism).

>What about allowing expats to construct places of worship?

Funny that's it's now a touchy subject for a lot of people. We had a chapel in Addu for the british and it was not that controversial back then.

It's important to improve the human rights and living conditions of the expats and freely practicing their own religion on their personal space is part of that. 

We probably should not let anyone build any type of public place for worshipping, just look at king salman mosque here in Mal√©.

It's up to the people to choose whether we want Sharia or Democracy. There's no middle ground between the 2 as they are completely different systems of governance.

And as long as these people in power stay in these high places of power influencing Muslims and non-Muslims with their bigotry; Islam will continue to get a bad name. 

And it‚Äôs not just about Islam, Hinduism is also going through this turmoil. Just look at what‚Äôs happening in India where far right Hindu fanatics have hijacked the Hindu religion and created a Jihadi version of it. 

Even in Christianity, the rise of intolerant right wing and far right practitioners has given rise to right wing dictators and politicians to power. 

Fortunately, the younger generation of Maldives are mostly liberal with a broad mindset so I feel this bad interpretation of Islam will eventually change when the old generation dies along with these bigoted mindsets.

27,27,jw7vj5g,">It seems that the king then asked the whole country to convert into Islam. 
>Maldivian Islam seems to have that dictatorial flavour since origin. 

Yes, true but it's a myth that the whole country converted in 1153 when ""Dharumavantha"" (likely Sri Thirubhuvana Aditya) converted. We know from written evidence (e.g. Kudahuvadhoo loamaafaanu) that it took atleast a century to form a very syncretic version of local Islam. Scarce documents we have from the period shows that early form of Islam would be unrecognizable to a modern Maldivian. 

Since then over last 7 centuries a lot happened. Neither religion nor culture ever remained static. Islam like any other religion was a dictatorial tool at times, other times it was a tool used  by the lesser nobles and commoners to popularize and weaken the influence of the rulers. There were times Islam was used as an excuse to justify oppression and slavery, but there were also times when it was invoked for egalitarian purpose like ending oppression and slavery (e.g. King Moheydin and Chief Judge Tajjudin). Like any political tool, how religion is used depends on whomever is wielding it.

 Over the centuries we also had kings who tried to impose their version of Islam, Christianity or whatever version of 'Shariah' that was prevalent in that century. As you may know very few succeeded. Some killed their opposition, destroyed old mosques and defunct monastaries, rebuilt mosques that they deemed suitable. Take for example, Sri Rajeswaran(13thCE), Haji Hassan (15thCE) and Mohamed of Dhevadhoo (18thCE); all religious despots who used Islam as a tool but practiced entirely different forms of the faith that would contradict the others.

However, taking account of 800 years of written history very few rulers were actual theocrats. Majority of rulers operated by their own interest not out of spirituality or religion.


>Wasn‚Äôt the king then converted by Arabic traders etc to Islam

 This simplified explanation is likely the case for most of the muslim majority places in ""Maritime silk road"", but it's actually more complicated in each case. Also, often ""Arab traders"" were neither arab or not even muslim. Other than religious commodities such as charms, books and artifacts; designs, ideas and architecture from the middle east were exchanged during this period and Islam was just a part of it.

 As we know in Maldives, there were a lot of Sufi proselyters but earliest person we can date is from 13th century. We're  not exactly sure why most of the Vajrayana Buddhist cultures in this route converted to Islam, but there is a hypothesis[1] that it have more to do with the spells, charms and relics the 'Arab' traders were trading. There is also the fact that the religious practices were very much localized by caste or was exclusive to groups, so it fostered an environment for religious syncretism. Unlike parts of North East India and South East Asia, we are not entirely sure about how things were in the Maldives.

However the most likely motivation for adopting Islam in the Maldives may have been political or economic reasons. After all, one of the earliest written records from 12th century is actually property endowment and tax decrees issued by the kings. Based on these documents we know that there seem to have been a radical powershift within the existing system. Conversely, it could have been Islam that triggered this powershift rather than the other way around.

For example, Isdhoo loamaafaanu (~1193ce) by Sri Gagana Aditya documents the execution of monks who opposed the royal order to convert, destruction of their monastaries but then focusing more on abolition of old taxes imposed by previous non-muslim kings and dues for certain influential families.

Flimsy? You mean Tarikh specifically, or just the few documents we have laying around?

üòÇ Yeah, I agree Tarikh manuscripts are biased. After all they all serve a political purpose for Hassan Tajuddin and his family who was very much involved with the events they're talking about.

60,60,jw8ql2z,"""It seems that the king then asked the whole country to convert into Islam. Maldivian Islam seems to have that dictatorial flavour since origin.""

I disagree with this. In my opinion, even if we tolerated certain leaders, Maldives was never dictatorial in its essence. And certainly not in terms of religion. Our leaders were always good to their people, even if they were despots and sometimes despised their immediate family. But I think Islam and the power it held in politics was certainly the prominent narrative at the time of Iskandar III when the first constitution was written. The Maldivian identified first as a Muslim. Go ahead and read any speech given in public for the last 50 years.  I think the issue is more complex when it comes to sovereignty.

There's a dialogue here posted by the OP and I was referring to that. And I wasn't making a point against you. But expressly agree with you. History itself is not questionable but historians and their perspectives. And who's to say that there wasn't support for the conversion? The reason that it took many years only goes to show that there was a lot happening. And even if the population converted fearing reprisals, why is this harsher than when the Mayan villages were wiped out by the Spanish? And if we had mass killings there must be mass graves. Besides there was very little incentive to force anything on Maldivians. If Bell's descriptions were right, we are gullible people easily swayed (although fiercely nationalistic) up until we found our footing in more modern times. I would say specifically around Nasir's rule.

The 'historical context' (800 plus years) that I referred to was in terms of sovereignty, nothing else. This debate is about a point in our constitution. But consider this, we haven't had the death sentence in our country except in one previous case and now once again recently If I'm not mistaken. It has never been carried out in modern times. I think that's a sign of cautiousness. And when it comes to letting people practice out in the open we should at least consider our identity,  in spite of history. 'You cut off a people from their history and you cut off their roots.'

It's not just the case of Sanyal, but a few more Indian writers, who wish to have a more central, India-dominant narrative with account to history for the benefit of their technocrat class (I actually think Sanjeev Sanyal has a better grasp of Indian Ocean Histories than most).  And I see no problem with that. They are struggling with the same issues and the current government is aggressively Hindu (India still is very much caste-based by the way, you can see that even in their writing).  And don't even get me started on the bourgeoise classes (still existing) in the West, in spite of the views and warnings of philosophers such as Chomsky, and theorists like Gladwell and Alain de Botton. And the self-made techno-elite (Bill Gates).It's fine to apply modernist thinking from the comfort of a cushioned bed, but let's not forget, there are two main narratives in Maldives. That of an  'elite landowner class', who think that they should be able to enjoy the pleasures of a more hedonistic lifestyle. Even if that means controlling their landowner status at the cost of social unrest. And that of the more common person, who still identifies with their culture and the need to make ends meet. When it comes to the institutions and laws, I think it's better left to the latter. And that in theory is the state. Our state as far as the law rules until now, is one religion. And in a country as small as Maldives, I think that's a good thing (that is my opinion, in spite of coming across as being sarcastic, which I'm not irl). I also think it's a good thing that we are open to creating more opportunities and jobs, and a healthier expat community. And no, I don't think it's a good thing that we take advantage of them. But when it comes to 'allowing' other religions. That's a technicality in the law. Nobody is forcing Islam on others in the Maldives (unlike what some people here think). If you identify as non-muslim. That's your concern. But as per law, yes. You can't be a non-Muslim and be a Maldivian. That can only be changed by law right now. And even if that is changed in my opinion right now one religion is what will work in the Maldives. I can be proven wrong. But I don't see it yet.",3,4,2023-08-15 04:20:41 UTC,2,Sh4uki,15qeqe6

(I'm happy someone took time to write a reply)  I already got that you were not making a point against me, I was adding my own opinon to your post. You probably want this conversation with OP not me. I was pretty much making the point against the claim that religion was only a ""dictatorial tool"" narrative, so this whole reply seems a bit moot.  

Tldr, of my post was most rulers used religion for their own person benefit. Also, Islam was adopted slowly over a century, with small scale social changes not with mass violence within 10 years. I'm not sure if you're understanding my post, it doesn't have any subtext. We probably should make a different thread to have your conversation as it's getting off topic.


>was certainly the prominent narrative at the time of Iskandar III

We don't call him Iskandar III, that's not his name and we also don't number our sultans like the British. Sultan Shamsuddin Iskander III is the third king with Shamsuddin name. First was the foreign king, other uncle of dhon bandaara who built kallhu vakaru miskiy and then him. Maldivian sultan's reignal name usually have an identifier to distinguish other than the biruda and full arabic title we get. For example, Dhiyamigili Ibrahim rasgefaanu would be Ibrahim Iskander II and only Iskander rasgefaanu in any context would mean Utheemi Ibrahim Iskander I. Imadduddin II, III and IV is known to Maldivians by 'Muzaffar', 'Mukarram' and 'Muskulhi' prefix other than their local names. 

P.S I guess we have similar political leanings.

Earlier Iskander rasgefaanu kicked the Qadiriyya sects out of Maldives. They came back while his wife Mariyam was the regent, plot against her. Moheyddin brought back his a'lim who was briefly installed as a king.

 Then triggered the period where the ulema practically ruled Maldives and it was almost theocracy. Look at all the reforms made during this period, especially by Dhevadhoo rasgefaanu. A lot of radical social reforms were issued. He also rebuilt a lot of mosques, take a look at kuda huvadhoo mosque contrast between parts of the surviving portion of the old entrance and wall. 

Other than that we had a lot of religious turmoil, the whole war between the goan portuguese, their collaboraters and Utheemu brothers is explicitly described as a religious conflict by Tajuddin himself in Tarikh. In fact first two section of the manuscript is a political and religious treatise.

'Tarikh' is also filled with instances of executions by drowning, burning and beheadings all for different reasons; political, religious or just pissing of the king. There were a lot of treason, scheming and backstabbing  going on, that is hard to summarize in a reddit post.

94,94,jwf1cae,"Why? Why should I adhere to any ideals when the Quran is clear enough to guide you? And there is no reason to turn atheist or agnostic to realize this. 

There is no concepts of Shia or Sunni in the Quran. Sunni and Shia were/are just political creations after the Prophet‚Äôs death in the wild struggle for political power in his absence. In the quest to legitimize and claim one was better over the other - rituals, narratives, morals and selective interpretations were ideated and created. After all, religion is a powerful opium to unite and control mass populations. As if the violent genocidal Crusades are testimony to this, the Second World War and the sectarian and communal strifes since then across the world is enough testimony how religion can be used to spread hate, violence, intolerance and bigotry.  

In its truest essence, Sufism is perhaps the best way to embrace Islam but unfortunately, it‚Äôs given a mystical Rastafarian tone while Sunnis and Shias want to outdo each other as the best version of Islam ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I have also read the Bible (both the new and old) and it‚Äôs many interpretations, the Torah and also the Vedas and Bhagwad Gita of Hinduism and I believe all of them preach the secular oneness of god ultimately and preach elementary advice - that to be a good person and live an ethical altruistic kind happy life.

Offspring's are also still referred in genders. Dhiye for daughter fuh/futhaa for son is more common than ""dhari"", as was in Old Dhivehi. I don't know when Male dialect start to use gendering less frequent. I'm curious how many Nothern dialects still use it.

See this link for reference: https://ling-app.com/ja/technology-words-in-japanese/

With all due respect, I personally feel that this is not a problem faced by the Dhivehi language only, but many Asian languages as well. I do believe that people do tend to be a tad too critical and harsh on Dhivehi in this regard.

0,0,h8509nn,"I‚Äôve spoken to many locals when there, and not all resorts and situations are created equal. I even saw a French TV report recently and it featured my local dive master / buddy. He was born on an island that is 10 mins away, so he could commute daily if conditions were horrendous, he chooses to live on the island. He earns a salary that wouldn‚Äôt be nearly horrible by western standards. I‚Äôm from the EU and I think it‚Äôs about 4 times our minimum wage. The dude who cleaned our rooms spoke very good English and he said he‚Äôd been cleaning the same 5 rooms for 25 years now. If it were such a horrible place to work he could‚Äôve easily gone elsewhere with his level of English. I also heard that for some foods the crew get their own kind (like rice is cheaper rice from India) but for most of the things it‚Äôs the same as guests, for example there are cold cuts and bread out all day for the crew and anyone can make themselves sandwiches without any limits at any time. Keep in mind this is food they serve to people like Tom Hardy, the A list actor (it‚Äôs his favorite hotel).

The only thing unusual by western standards (albeit not that part of the world and esp not muslim countries), is that different people have different rights, but strangely enough the locals have the fewest. So they can‚Äôt drink alcohol or have pork in the resorts even if it‚Äôs available to staff for example. Things of that nature. 

I realize I only saw a slice, but when our waiter told us he earns plenty to make a living for his entire family and he gets more time off than we westerners do and he takes his family to one of many nice local islands for a beach vacation, I was actually somewhat envious. Nature is the same for everyone obviously. 

I know this might not be the standard, baseline and I am told this is one of the most ‚Äúlocal centric‚Äù hotels in the entire country (even some of top management is local), but I don‚Äôt feel bad when I go there, I know that my money is definitely make a positive impact on the locals‚Äô lives as well as being a minimal burden on the environment (they bottle their own water in glass, they sort the garbage vehemently, they have an incinerator, etc.). 

The hotel is called Lily Beach.

1,1,h85fphf,"Maldives had a change of government since 2018, the current government is more liberal and left-leaning compared to the more repressive government of Yameen Abdul Qayoom.  From what I recall, the ex-president of the Maldives was sentenced for 5 years for embezzlement few years ago. 

Last time Maldives had politically motivated internet censorship was back in the early 2000s when I was a teenager under Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's regime. While there are no internet censorship laws, I think there have been few cases where politicians abuse anti-defamation laws. I think people can get in trouble for making death threats to politicians. There's a lot about local politics and the progress of human rights issues since 2008 reforms, which I cannot summarise here in one post. 

Ever since the Maldives Independent and Minivan news shut down, you'll find fewer english language news outlets that does political analysis. But if you google, you may find some english language news outlets that are politically neutral.

As for the resorts, I recall a post in this subbreddit of a resort owner that was caught exploiting the local ecosystem. I think it is a good idea to boycott such resorts. You have to remember that Maldives is around 1000 small coral islands, and only 185 of them have local population. Just about 4 of them are considered as population centers. Resort owners can in practice disregards the local laws protecting the environment without any consequences.

You are right that most Maldivians probably do not experience Maldives as tourists do. Speaking from my own experience, I've never been to a resort and do not like the ocean but I've always appreciated the fact tourism rejuvenated the local economy in the 70s. 

Most social problems in the country have nothing to do with tourism. Before it became a republic, 'Maldives' was an exonym for a very old kingdom which had a centralised fuedal system in place to control their territory. The country became a british protectorate in 1887 because of a complex family rivalry within the ruling dynasty, which ended with one branch consolidating the power with the help of the British.

 From 1940s to late 1950s the kingdom was struggling to keep its territories under control, there were multiple secessionist movements from north and south of the kingdom. Tourism was introduced in 1970s after it became a republic with the same ruling class still holding power. 

Until very recently it was this same class of former nobility which held positions in the government. Even today the endonym for the country 'Dhivehi Raajje' literally means Island Kingdom.

There's the occasional political assassination attempt or someone from the opposing party ending up in jail for the rest of their life but I guess that's pretty common in all countries now. 

I think someone more familiar with local politics can give you a better answer on that.

But for the rest of us - we have the basic stuff. Cost of living is much higher than the average wage.

* Dhiffushi (big island) (6 days)
* Dhiffushi Resort (small island) (5 days)
* Mal√©. (2 days)

I am:

* From Denmark
* Fully vaccinated

1 day before flying, I will do a PCR test.

* PCR test 4 days prior arrival in Maldives
* PCR test 3 days before check-out of each guesthouse

* 1 in Denmark
* 1 before check-out of the first hotel
* 1 before check-out of the second hotel

Before going to the second hotel I need to do another PCR test, but I can't find any information on where to do the PCR test on [Dhiffushi](https://www.google.dk/maps/place/Dhiffushi/@4.4419622,73.7114756,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b3f916d9c4395c5:0x89b05894a4ae0485!8m2!3d4.4401762!4d73.7132147).

* NO visiting of local island before coming to the private resort. If you go to a local island, you will NOT be allowed to enter the private island, even if you have a negative PCR test
* If you choose to stay at another resort before coming to the next resort, you must send them a negative PCR test 48 hours PRIOR arrival.


So you CANNOT do it in the following order:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Local island (they do not care if you have a negative PCR test result with you)
* Resort

You CAN do the following:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort
* Local island 

You CAN also do it like this:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort - take a PCR test 48 hours prior arrival at next resort 
* Resort 


About the split-stays: it's possible and the place you are staying will do the formalities, just inform them where you are going next. If you can do it, send them an email with this information before going to the Maldives.

I will advice you to contact the resort you are staying at and ask them about the restrictions they have. It seems like the resorts can make their own COVID restrictions..

When are you going?

Also some other guests needed a PCR for their home country or the airline they travel with. And also this was organized by the resort.

1,1,j1c561i,"There‚Äôs a lot of sense in what OP is trying to say but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think that we can overcome this issue in the near future as there could be several factors contributing to this targeted xenophobia. 

I think that we‚Äôre stuck in an odd yet hopeful juncture; modern vs traditional. The former being predominant among among Gen Z, lower age group from Millennials and the latter ideology and customs being distributed highly among Gen X and older millennials. This affects how each of these groups perceive and accept societal and cultural norms as well as see the flaws and areas for improvement. To put it short: it‚Äôs the young ones who can break this chain of bias and bigotry. 

As for how we Maldivians treat foreigners: be it tourists or expatriates, you don‚Äôt have to look far to understand this elitism or sense of superiority (Mal√© vs non-Mal√© inhabitants/residents). When we view fellow countrymen and women from different parts of the country as inferior, how can we treat citizens of different nationalities with equality? Sad truth is the people of this country is a prime example of Dunning-Kruger effect and superiority complexes everywhere. 

Then there‚Äôs the political element. Remember the herd mentality prevalent among Maldivians. Sheeple indeed. We‚Äôre stuck at a challenging position when it comes to geo politics. Depending on the leader, bilateral relations and alliances vary and as such today it might be pro-India, tomorrow pro-China and so on. So whatever (mis)information and propaganda is directed from the top is what comes down to the average citizen as well. 

Personally, I feel we should accept each and every country with the same kindness and hospitality regardless of nationality; especially seeing how dependent we are on tourism and mostly because it‚Äôs the decent thing to do!",3,0,2022-12-23 05:12:23 UTC,0,Grobyx,zseqd9

Anyway, since you are discussing about what 'Maldivians' think of themselves, I got some things to add. 

I think, what we now think of as modern Maldivian identity and nationalism emerged mid 20th century forged by the ruling class of the time. History was revised; it was no longer a persian but a moroccan who was buried in the central shrine. 

Hussein Salahuddin sanitized the Boduthakurufaanu story (compared to Buraara koi) and further framed it as an anti-colonial struggle. It was previously framed as a religious and political struggle by Hassan Tajuddin in the 18th century manuscript. 

Somewhere over time the local form of Sufi Islam became part of the culture and eventually after several religious reformations it was superceded by a more mainstream Islam. Before that,  based on few lines of the surviving copperplate from 13th century (Kudahuvadhoo) it looks like early Maldivian Islam was a localised form of the religion with syncretic elements.

Maybe a large part of our current problem is that the dichotomy between religion and culture was never properly addressed by Maldivians themselves. The common perception is that Islam was introduced in 12th CE as it was practiced until the early 20th. However, if you look at the written records it is evidently false, there was a lot of persecutions; both religious and political and over time what we now think of as Dhivehi identity emerged. 


My point is, we have to understand that 'Dhivehi' culture itself has evolved a lot over time and it's likely going to keep changing like any other culture. The best we can do is to reflect and try to understand how we came here.


p.s: Maldivians have been fetishizing/emulating Arabs and Persians atleast for 5 centuries. However, our religious words and concepts are still rooted in borrowed Sanskrit phrases inherited from the Buddhist traditions.  Until the 19th century our word for God was Dheyvatha. Five century was a long time, so I wouldn't worry about Arabisation of Dhivehi culture within the next 100 years.",5,0,2022-12-22 10:33:50 UTC,2,z80lives,zseqd9

I had a similar experience while I was visiting the Maldives. I found many people had a great deal of respect and admiration for the European and Arab cultures, but at the same time, the same cultures shared some of the same values which I had seen in other parts of Asia, such as the importance of family and mental health. It's interesting to see how the culture is adapting to modern times, but at the same time, retaining some of the traditional values which have been passed down for centuries.",2,0,2023-03-16 02:10:26 UTC,0,amy_mighty_travels,zseqd9

I'm not worried about the Arabisation. I do worry about the lack of self reflection,  critical thinking and tendency to be easily manipulated by superstition or propaganda among Maldivians today which I think are bigger problems. 

I didn't have the words for it for a long time but I sometimes feel like a guy whose never seen his reflection in a mirror when it comes to our cultural identity and history and I reckon many ordinary  Maldivians feel the same.",1,1,2022-12-22 11:11:47 UTC,0,thedrifter129,zseqd9
