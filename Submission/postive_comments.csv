I think I have more than enough for the game, so don't want to impose on your time if you are busy, or if it's too much effort. In case you get some free time, please do share -  would love to read, just out of curiosity/interest - I am sure rest of the subreddit would appreciate it as well.  

In the meantime, will try to process all of the info you have shared. 

Thank you once again.

jv06dwj,"1. som tam Thai. Used to be previously called ""chim Thai "". Too as OP mentioned it is a owned by older Maldivian and Thai couple..I can second what OP says. Even the prices are reasonable. 


Recently tried KFZ- korean food zone  at hulhumale.  It is run by a Korean lady. Cute personality and creates the vibe and feel of a Korean place. And the food is authentic  . Thou might be just slightly a little high end on the pricing. It is worth for the experience.


As for symphony and  Italian dishes. Hmmm well they are too Maldivianized. At this point.  Yeah I understand cannot serve most Italian dishes due to halal. But can keep to the concept the theme of the original dish. 
For instance carbonara base of the dish is 
- Cured pork cheeks /pancetta 
- egg/egg yolks 
- parmesan/ pecorino

So why not just replace the cured meat with a halal beef based cured meat. Still this will not change the base of the dish. Which is even a served variant  in Italy to ppl who eat halal.

But here mostly it's take aways the eggs. Adds cream/ milk, Bell pepper. Cheddar cheese. Cream cheese parsley leafs . It is all a mushy mess.

jv1txuf,"Some of the games I like are very old, from PS1. I like harvest moon back to nature, digimon world 1, 2 and 3 plus digimon card battle, which are all ps1 games, but my fav digimon game is digimon world next order. I like turn based games too like civ games and ff games, especially ff8 but ff15 is my fav game in the ff series. While I'm on ff, I should say I didn't play all the ff games and would like to mention I liked dissidia too. I don't particularly like God of war but still a good game that I did enjoy. I like dmc too, haven't played dmc 1 and 5 yet, 3 has been my fav so far. Also I like the assassin's Creed games, playing unity now and I actually played all the main assassin's Creed games up to unity. For mobile games, the online games I play are mobile legends bang bang and coc, for an offline game I play an indie game called world rumble. Also would like to mention mount and blade 2: bannerlord, while I'm not particularly good in this game I do enjoy it. I did play dark souls but didn't finish it, I would maybe finish them in the future but for now I have other games I want to try more. I also like games like red alert, Warhammer 40k dawn of war, age of empires. For red alert, I liked red alert 2 Yuri's revenge the best and for age of empires, I liked 2 best.

Now there are definitely some games I'm forgetting here. I mostly like single player games with a good story.

jv2rjoq,"I haven't played video game more recently, but I used to play a lot. Most of them are a bit older, but I hope you'll enjoy them. I'll list down 10 games that has good replay value.

1. Final Fantasy VI
2. The Sims
3. Mass effect series (- not Andromeda, that's garbage)
4. Super Metroid
5. Castlevania 
6. Fire Emblem any of the GBA games
7. Mother / Earthbound series.
8. Tetris
9. X-Com
10. Elder Scrolls (any game in this series holds up)

I picked ff6, because I played all final fantasy titles progressively till 10 and it is really the best one. Along with Chrono Trigger, Earthbound and Lufia II it's probably the best jrpg of it's time. 

Mass effect, because it has a decent story and good space opera. 

Castlevania and Metroid, has the best gameplay ever designed. Discovered Super Metroid when I wrote a paper on it (about symbolism and narrative) for college assignment (also portal and ""To the moon""), it has a good replay value. 

Fire Emblem; I played to pass time when commuting.
X-COM and battle toad whenever I wanted something challenging, I hate contra and metal slug is way easy.

Tetris, hard to believe for some but probably the best game ever made. I used to write tetris and snake in every new language, emulator or platform I work on. Even wrote one for ""z80lives"", my old partially complete but abandoned z80 based computer emulator suite.  Ironically it's name ""lives"" on as my internet handle.

Additionally; 

Liked GTA Sa and GTA 3 ( 4 and 5 not so much lol )

RDR 2 is a masterpiece  ( haven't played 1 )

FF16 and FF7 are excellent as well

Assassin's Creed ( up to syndicate. haven't played anything after that )

Resident Evil (all the recent ones)

Ghost of Tsushima

TLOU 1 ( 2 is utter trash btw )

Dmc ( every main entry apart from dmc 2 is really good)

jw9xyeu,"“Devout Muslim” according to whom? And why? 

If you have really read and researched the Quran, you would have known that
It’s a one to one connection between god and you..: it’s not at all a hard religion unlike what muslim preachers and non Muslims want everyone to believe 

Islam in my opinion is a just a way of life - to be a nice ethical person. And that’s about it.

All the other things muslim do are just rituals that many devout Muslims indulge it; not mandatory things the Quran asks you to do. 

Of course there are bad things in Quran but we have to apply common sense and see it from the historical time and society of those days when it was imposed upon.

I don’t prescribe to what conservative and ignorant hard stance Muslim preachers and extreme leaders preach or dictate how a Muslim should live their life. People who blindly follow them are just too lazy to research and critique Islam. So, they grow up following this ritualistic pattern of Islam which they pass on to their next generation.

ha0e7bx,"Haha, I'm glad I skimmed through the introduction of that report. 'You make your own soul', ok. But I agree with its findings about the Maldives.

We have a cultural dogma. I think the majority here believe that Maldivians are special because they are part of a pure group. 'No non-Muslims'. Uncorrupted by 'kafir' ideology. It's a legal fiction.

Maldivian institutional systems do not adequately support protection of ***any*** minority rights. But religious minorities just don't exist in the law. u/CapnHanSolo interestedly mentioned the Geneva Conventions. The situation here accurately contravenes the very spirit of the 1992 declaration on minorities (UNGA resolution 47/135) and of Maldives' own constitutional protections (Chapter 2).

If you're a religious minority, and you have angered the majority - they are legally sanctioned to imprison you. There's no sense in sugar-coating it. How often this happens is irrelevant to the fact that it is allowed to happen and there's a framework for it. If the moratorium on death penalty is lifted, they can even execute you. A legal murder. Maldivian law is stubborn and unjust in this area.

Minority groups are substantial enough that people can always live a relatively free life if we do not push the majority narrative too hard. But with both groups as vocal as they are now, I feel that might not be the case soon.

PS:. Tourism in Maldives has existed in enclaves. Bubbles. Workers at guesthouses at substantially tourist islands like Maafushi are distant from the experience of Maldivians in inhabited islands and cities (who form the majority vote). They are valuable input as experience of Maldivians, but they live very far from institutions and the law (labour law too, sadly).",3,0,2021-08-23 08:38:34 UTC,0,paradiserythm,p9jy34,t3_p9jy34,1743,FALSE,False,maldives,0.517501652,0.158845022,0.323653311,0.688081503,0.029857073,0.282061398,,,,positive,positive,,positive
