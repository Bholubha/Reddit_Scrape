js37r3s,"I think there are a lot of things that will need to change before things get better in that sense.

For one thing let me talk about the general public for a moment. Even though we call ourselves a Republic I do not believe our collective consciousness has truly embraced or understood the idea of a Republic or a Democracy. 

And this is ingrained on a cultural level starting from the royalty and the psuedo democracy that replaced that with beyfulhun's. Let us take a look at our language for one thing. In democracies we have leaders, not rulers. But to us we have only verin. Verin is the word for rulers, leaders and even owners. I am the verimeeha of the property I own. I should not be the verimeeha of people I am meant to lead.

And this mentality can be seen when you really think about it. We elect people, but then have this expectation that if the president/minister etc wants something to happen that should happen. That if you have a problem they should immediately be able to fix it by telling people to do so. And are upset when that does not happen. But that's not how democracies or leaderships work. That is how rulers rule. 

And then we have all these councils and commissions, where by law the president of such does not have an exceedingly great authority over the rest of its members. They are meant to work as a group, with the president leading and been the focal point. But what ends up is this culture of verimeeha makes the whole thing into whatever he/she wants happens. 

Ofcourse I do not really believe this is the general public's fault. It's just our ingrained culture we have yet been unable to change.",1,1,2023-07-15 17:33:04 UTC,0,crimson_solace,14z6nnb,t1_js0l0pi,1639,FALSE,False,maldives,0.038528502,0.626863122,0.334608376,0.096028253,0.154849052,0.74912262,,,,nagative,neutral,,nagative

jrxcb5i,"As anywhere in the world, I guess you can always make new friends while networking for work related things, or school related stuff if you're a younger. Ask people you know in your field of work for for a tea/coffee or just hangout in general. Avoid talking politics first and things you don't have in common.  Have conversations about things you like, TV shows, music or fishing. People who share some common interest as you will start to hang out more often. Or sometimes, people with different opinions sometimes would like to know the other side more. 

I'm assuming you're young. As you grow older you'll have different type of friends, people who used to hangout wont always be the same people who helps you out when you're in financial trouble, or loan you money when your kid is sick.

At Lanka. On the 3rd day there ,was stuck in traffic at a busy junction. Just barely got out of the traffic to enter a building at the other corner of the junction.

.. well after this met with 2 other blast at very close proximity. To realise and feel the impact of the blasts. But never got as scared as tht first time. Last two there were no casualties.

And don't worry these were long long back. Since the war is over. Nothing like this could be there. Even then it was pretty safe mostly. Only my luck was on good and bad terms.

jstsq1e,"It could very well be a contributing factor but I think how one is raised is far more important. I have been renting my whole life, but I am the kind of person who tries to bring even an empty bottle home so that I can put it in my dustbin. I also dis-agree that people don't litter in their own houses, you will be surprised at just how filthy some places are.

I think it's mainly a matter of the collective culture, and also a bit of the broken window theory from sociology. Which states that existing signs of anti social behavior encourages further anti-social behavior. 

The idea here being that litter/dirt attracts more dirt. Even I have been guilty of this sometimes. If I see a pile of rubbish on the street it is easy to think my additional bottle or tissue paper won't make a difference. And this is also kind of apparent if you go to a lot of islands outside the greater male' area. Where you have garbage free beaches or streets. They still litter there to an extent too. But people will rarely want to be the first guy to spoil a pristine beach or street, so they will chuck it into the trees XD (which is still bad and where the idea of littering being culturally acceptable comes in)

And of course another issue is the lack of public bins. In like most other countries I have been in, you can easily find public bins to put in simple garbage like wrappers or bottles, but not here. And there is a reason for this too. When that was tried it was either destroyed or people just dumb in household waste that rots and destroys or just stuff they don't want to take to the dump. So again culture playing in.

We definitely do need to punish people who litter. Properly punishing, and enforcing such punishments and yes even shaming people for littering definitely would go a long way towards changing this culture. Those that don't litter in their own houses but do in public, do so because at home they will face consequences. Been forced to clean up or been yelled at by those who have to clean up after them. Whereas if you face no consequences for doing it in public they will just keep doing it.",9,0,2023-07-21 04:45:08 UTC,0,crimson_solace,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,2115,FALSE,False,maldives,0.001043573,0.99454993,0.004406513,0.022725996,0.573505461,0.40376851,,,,nagative,negative,,nagative

jsuh2i0,"Personally, I have never been someone who litters, so I never really understood why anyone could litter. However, I did read a lot about it, and like it was mentioned in a previous comment, your theory could be one of the factors. 

A lack of bins is also certainly comtributing factor. This issue mostly ties in with city planning I suppose. Finding public waste disposal areas in the Mal√© and Hulhumal√© certainly is quite the task. 

However, some people just choose to litter even when bins are nearby. Again, as mentioned in a previous comment, littering has become so prevalent in our society that we feel our own littering won't contribute much to the issue. Or some people probably just don't care about it. 

Like you mentioned, passing legislature regarding littering and proper enforcement could encourage people not to litter. We tend to pass a lot of bills and introduce a lot of new laws here, but the laws are usually not enforced very well. So, there's that as well. 

I also think that we can incentivize not littering by rewarding people who don't litter.

jv959n4,"As a thalassemic patient myself. As in not a career but someone who has to take regular transfusions, my answer to this has always been don't break up JUST because of that. It is a controversial opinion yes and people usually disagree with me on this.  


First let me just give you the obvious options of adopting or as mentioned here the genetic engineering IVF avenues if you have the money. Though I am not 100% sure how viable that is. You should do a bit more research on that. But if any of those are an option for you, then I mean you have no issues right?  
On the issue of having an actual thalasemic child, here is how I see things. Even thalassemia aside life has no guarantees. You could get a child who requires some special care in another form. Yes marrying as career's raises that risk, but in a sense, it also gives you the chance to consider whether that is something both of you can face as a couple. There is a quote I quite like, It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease, than to know what sort of disease a person has. Here it is what sort of person you are that would matter. Even today due to lack of awareness a lot of people will see thalasemic's as sick. Sick in the sense they are weak and cannot do everything normal people does. But that is not true at all, with proper treatment, there are thalasemic's doing all sort of things. One even goes bodu kahneli fishing ah. As you know that is a very physically demanding job.  


What is most important to understand is that it's going to be physically, mentally and financially draining. Especially when the child is young and don't understand things, you are going to have to force them to take the proper treatment. They will cry and fight against it, and you will have to be strong enough to deal with that. And while there are now tablet medications that can be used, most thalasemic's still take medication through a syringe and a pump that has to be on them throughout the night on most nights. When I was doing thing it meant sacrificing evenings because I did not want to go out like that. But there are many that do. And if you can afford it there are small easy to carry pumps as well.  


Which comes to the financial aspect. Do not think that the government will take care of everything, so you don't have to worry. For one thing sometimes you have to spend for better quality of life than government provides. And while a lot of tests and stuff can be done here now, you must consider that sometimes you may have to go abroad, and even with all the social protection that is still quite a hassle, and can be financially burdensome. And then there is the whole thing of further studies like degrees and stuff. If the kid wants to go abroad for studies, unless in very rare circumstances you are going to have to foot the bill of their treatment, the government will not cover that. I faced this in my own studies.  


So I suppose the bottom line is can you handle all this, both financially, and as a couple. And the whole issue of putting your child through all this. Well that is a very difficult thing to answer and I suppose would depend on the kind of kid he/she turns out to be. I rarely if ever felt like bad for been a thalasemic. That would be a combination of my parents plus my own personality, so ofcours mileage is going to vary. But I think been a strong example for your child, and not treating them as like weak and sick will go far.  


If you have any people who you trust and knows the both of you well and will be honest with you talk to them. Ask for their honest opinion even if it will hurt you, see if they think you can handle all this, and your marriage will survive it.

jviurn1,"I am all for selecting a non thalaseamic embryo via ivf screening. But as of now that is not something easily accessible for everyone in the similar way say just screening for thalassemia is.

And you have honestly highlighted my major issue. There are many other things that are passed genetically and can be screened for. But you rarely if ever hear someone saying about screening for those (yes I know you just did). There definitely isn't a systematic mandate in place to screen for anything other than thalassemia. And you certainly don't hear about people breaking up because they might pass on other genetic issues. It's only thalassemia that seems to be this significant medical diagnosis that is a cruel burden on the children. And that creates a very bad and untruthful impression about thalassemic patients on the general public as well on the patients themselves.

And while I am fully for screening embryos and choosing the best one, where does genetic screening when choosing partners lead? There are so many genetic conditions. Are we going to say some are ok and others are not? What someone thinks as significant will also differ from person to person. Are we going to avoid everything? At that point we might as well just upload our dna profiles and make matches based on just that.

jw84h1t,"u/Maakanaa I think this is the most polarized thread I've seen recently in here üòÇ

Personally, I don't think state should ever be involved in religion.


Maldives is a monoethnic nation - like Malays of Malaysia - we seem to have infused cultural and religious identity. So I don't think state hold on religion will go away anytime soon.

We also have this religious nationalism formed not long ago and more recently a pan Islamic identity (btw, modern salafi movement also falls under Islamic modernism).

>What about allowing expats to construct places of worship?

Funny that's it's now a touchy subject for a lot of people. We had a chapel in Addu for the british and it was not that controversial back then.

It's important to improve the human rights and living conditions of the expats and freely practicing their own religion on their personal space is part of that. 

We probably should not let anyone build any type of public place for worshipping, just look at king salman mosque here in Mal√©.

jw4ofxw,"If you go strictly by what the Quran says and what the prophet practiced, non-Muslims are explicitly allowed to practice their religion and they should not be persecuted.

And as long as these people in power stay in these high places of power influencing Muslims and non-Muslims with their bigotry; Islam will continue to get a bad name. 

And it‚Äôs not just about Islam, Hinduism is also going through this turmoil. Just look at what‚Äôs happening in India where far right Hindu fanatics have hijacked the Hindu religion and created a Jihadi version of it. 

Even in Christianity, the rise of intolerant right wing and far right practitioners has given rise to right wing dictators and politicians to power. 

Fortunately, the younger generation of Maldives are mostly liberal with a broad mindset so I feel this bad interpretation of Islam will eventually change when the old generation dies along with these bigoted mindsets.

I was pretty much making the point against the claim that religion was only a ""dictatorial tool"" narrative, so this whole reply seems a bit moot.  

Tldr, of my post was most rulers used religion for their own person benefit. Also, Islam was adopted slowly over a century, with small scale social changes not with mass violence within 10 years. I'm not sure if you're understanding my post, it doesn't have any subtext. We probably should make a different thread to have your conversation as it's getting off topic.


>was certainly the prominent narrative at the time of Iskandar III

We don't call him Iskandar III, that's not his name and we also don't number our sultans like the British. Sultan Shamsuddin Iskander III is the third king with Shamsuddin name. First was the foreign king, other uncle of dhon bandaara who built kallhu vakaru miskiy and then him. Maldivian sultan's reignal name usually have an identifier to distinguish other than the biruda and full arabic title we get. For example, Dhiyamigili Ibrahim rasgefaanu would be Ibrahim Iskander II and only Iskander rasgefaanu in any context would mean Utheemi Ibrahim Iskander I. Imadduddin II, III and IV is known to Maldivians by 'Muzaffar', 'Mukarram' and 'Muskulhi' prefix other than their local names. 

P.S I guess we have similar political leanings.

Earlier Iskander rasgefaanu kicked the Qadiriyya sects out of Maldives. They came back while his wife Mariyam was the regent, plot against her. Moheyddin brought back his a'lim who was briefly installed as a king.

 Then triggered the period where the ulema practically ruled Maldives and it was almost theocracy. Look at all the reforms made during this period, especially by Dhevadhoo rasgefaanu. A lot of radical social reforms were issued. He also rebuilt a lot of mosques, take a look at kuda huvadhoo mosque contrast between parts of the surviving portion of the old entrance and wall. 

Other than that we had a lot of religious turmoil, the whole war between the goan portuguese, their collaboraters and Utheemu brothers is explicitly described as a religious conflict by Tajuddin himself in Tarikh. In fact first two section of the manuscript is a political and religious treatise.

'Tarikh' is also filled with instances of executions by drowning, burning and beheadings all for different reasons; political, religious or just pissing of the king.

jwf1cae,"Why? Why should I adhere to any ideals when the Quran is clear enough to guide you? And there is no reason to turn atheist or agnostic to realize this. 

There is no concepts of Shia or Sunni in the Quran. Sunni and Shia were/are just political creations after the Prophet‚Äôs death in the wild struggle for political power in his absence. In the quest to legitimize and claim one was better over the other - rituals, narratives, morals and selective interpretations were ideated and created. After all, religion is a powerful opium to unite and control mass populations. As if the violent genocidal Crusades are testimony to this, the Second World War and the sectarian and communal strifes since then across the world is enough testimony how religion can be used to spread hate, violence, intolerance and bigotry.

He was born on an island that is 10 mins away, so he could commute daily if conditions were horrendous, he chooses to live on the island. He earns a salary that wouldn‚Äôt be nearly horrible by western standards. I‚Äôm from the EU and I think it‚Äôs about 4 times our minimum wage. The dude who cleaned our rooms spoke very good English and he said he‚Äôd been cleaning the same 5 rooms for 25 years now. If it were such a horrible place to work he could‚Äôve easily gone elsewhere with his level of English. I also heard that for some foods the crew get their own kind (like rice is cheaper rice from India) but for most of the things it‚Äôs the same as guests, for example there are cold cuts and bread out all day for the crew and anyone can make themselves sandwiches without any limits at any time. Keep in mind this is food they serve to people like Tom Hardy, the A list actor (it‚Äôs his favorite hotel).

The only thing unusual by western standards (albeit not that part of the world and esp not muslim countries), is that different people have different rights, but strangely enough the locals have the fewest. So they can‚Äôt drink alcohol or have pork in the resorts even if it‚Äôs available to staff for example. Things of that nature. 

I realize I only saw a slice, but when our waiter told us he earns plenty to make a living for his entire family and he gets more time off than we westerners do and he takes his family to one of many nice local islands for a beach vacation, I was actually somewhat envious. Nature is the same for everyone obviously. 

I know this might not be the standard, baseline and I am told this is one of the most ‚Äúlocal centric‚Äù hotels in the entire country (even some of top management is local), but I don‚Äôt feel bad when I go there, I know that my money is definitely make a positive impact on the locals‚Äô lives as well as being a minimal burden on the environment (they bottle their own water in glass, they sort the garbage vehemently, they have an incinerator, etc.).

h85fphf,"Maldives had a change of government since 2018, the current government is more liberal and left-leaning compared to the more repressive government of Yameen Abdul Qayoom.  From what I recall, the ex-president of the Maldives was sentenced for 5 years for embezzlement few years ago. 

Last time Maldives had politically motivated internet censorship was back in the early 2000s when I was a teenager under Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's regime. While there are no internet censorship laws, I think there have been few cases where politicians abuse anti-defamation laws. I think people can get in trouble for making death threats to politicians. There's a lot about local politics and the progress of human rights issues since 2008 reforms, which I cannot summarise here in one post. 

Ever since the Maldives Independent and Minivan news shut down, you'll find fewer english language news outlets that does political analysis. But if you google, you may find some english language news outlets that are politically neutral.

As for the resorts, I recall a post in this subbreddit of a resort owner that was caught exploiting the local ecosystem. I think it is a good idea to boycott such resorts. You have to remember that Maldives is around 1000 small coral islands, and only 185 of them have local population. Just about 4 of them are considered as population centers. Resort owners can in practice disregards the local laws protecting the environment without any consequences.

You are right that most Maldivians probably do not experience Maldives as tourists do. Speaking from my own experience, I've never been to a resort and do not like the ocean but I've always appreciated the fact tourism rejuvenated the local economy in the 70s. 

Most social problems in the country have nothing to do with tourism. Before it became a republic, 'Maldives' was an exonym for a very old kingdom which had a centralised fuedal system in place to control their territory. The country became a british protectorate in 1887 because of a complex family rivalry within the ruling dynasty, which ended with one branch consolidating the power with the help of the British.

 From 1940s to late 1950s the kingdom was struggling to keep its territories under control, there were multiple secessionist movements from north and south of the kingdom. Tourism was introduced in 1970s after it became a republic with the same ruling class still holding power. 

Until very recently it was this same class of former nobility which held positions in the government. Even today the endonym for the country 'Dhivehi Raajje' literally means Island Kingdom.

Basically the British showed support for the Suadives but at the end of the day double crossed and made an agreement with the Male' government.

January 1960 - Addu atoll formally establishes Republic of Suvadive headed by Afeef Didi in Hithadhoo. Huvadhu and Fua Mulak atoll are also nominally part of Suvadive, but the British give protection only to Addu atoll.

April 1962 - British attempt to restore Addu to Male' rule but large violent demonstration in Gan rejects any change.

January/February 1962 - Ibrahim Nasir, aboard the Silver Crest, leads another armed attack on Thinadhoo on Huvadhu atoll, and Fua Mulak. Thinadhoo is leveled and population dispersed. Many people, driven from Thinadhoo onto surrounding islands, starve to death.

September 1963 - British agree to return Addu to Male' control by the end of 1963.
British political advisor Rounswaite actively lobbies Addu businessmen against Afeef and his administration.
Britain plans to establish a new and more powerful BBC short wave relay station on Maldives to serve Asia and East Africa.
Regiment from Butterworth in Malaysia ordered to Gan, and Rounswaite orders the Maldives flag to be raised in Maradhoo. Afeef and his supporters agree to end their revolt.
30 September 1963 - Abdulla Afeef and his family taken to Seychelles aboard HMS Loch Lomond.

j1c561i,"There‚Äôs a lot of sense in what OP is trying to say but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think that we can overcome this issue in the near future as there could be several factors contributing to this targeted xenophobia. 

I think that we‚Äôre stuck in an odd yet hopeful juncture; modern vs traditional. The former being predominant among among Gen Z, lower age group from Millennials and the latter ideology and customs being distributed highly among Gen X and older millennials. This affects how each of these groups perceive and accept societal and cultural norms as well as see the flaws and areas for improvement. To put it short: it‚Äôs the young ones who can break this chain of bias and bigotry. 

As for how we Maldivians treat foreigners: be it tourists or expatriates, you don‚Äôt have to look far to understand this elitism or sense of superiority (Mal√© vs non-Mal√© inhabitants/residents). When we view fellow countrymen and women from different parts of the country as inferior, how can we treat citizens of different nationalities with equality? Sad truth is the people of this country is a prime example of Dunning-Kruger effect and superiority complexes everywhere. 

Then there‚Äôs the political element. Remember the herd mentality prevalent among Maldivians. Sheeple indeed. We‚Äôre stuck at a challenging position when it comes to geo politics. Depending on the leader, bilateral relations and alliances vary and as such today it might be pro-India, tomorrow pro-China and so on. So whatever (mis)information and propaganda is directed from the top is what comes down to the average citizen as well. 

Personally, I feel we should accept each and every country with the same kindness and hospitality regardless of nationality; especially seeing how dependent we are on tourism and mostly because it‚Äôs the decent thing to do!",3,0,2022-12-23 05:12:23 UTC,0,Grobyx,zseqd9,t3_zseqd9,1824,1671772929,False,maldives,0.004461194,0.96720171,0.028337112,0.033934984,0.367073119,0.598991871,,,,nagative,neutral,,nagative

Anyway, since you are discussing about what 'Maldivians' think of themselves, I got some things to add. 

I think, what we now think of as modern Maldivian identity and nationalism emerged mid 20th century forged by the ruling class of the time. History was revised; it was no longer a persian but a moroccan who was buried in the central shrine. 

Hussein Salahuddin sanitized the Boduthakurufaanu story (compared to Buraara koi) and further framed it as an anti-colonial struggle. It was previously framed as a religious and political struggle by Hassan Tajuddin in the 18th century manuscript. 

Somewhere over time the local form of Sufi Islam became part of the culture and eventually after several religious reformations it was superceded by a more mainstream Islam. Before that,  based on few lines of the surviving copperplate from 13th century (Kudahuvadhoo) it looks like early Maldivian Islam was a localised form of the religion with syncretic elements.

Maybe a large part of our current problem is that the dichotomy between religion and culture was never properly addressed by Maldivians themselves. The common perception is that Islam was introduced in 12th CE as it was practiced until the early 20th. However, if you look at the written records it is evidently false, there was a lot of persecutions; both religious and political and over time what we now think of as Dhivehi identity emerged. 


My point is, we have to understand that 'Dhivehi' culture itself has evolved a lot over time and it's likely going to keep changing like any other culture. The best we can do is to reflect and try to understand how we came here.


p.s: Maldivians have been fetishizing/emulating Arabs and Persians atleast for 5 centuries. However, our religious words and concepts are still rooted in borrowed Sanskrit phrases inherited from the Buddhist traditions.  Until the 19th century our word for God was Dheyvatha. Five century was a long time, so I wouldn't worry about Arabisation of Dhivehi culture within the next 100 years.",5,0,2022-12-22 10:33:50 UTC,2,z80lives,zseqd9,t3_zseqd9,2162,FALSE,False,maldives,0.017837495,0.624141216,0.358021259,0.078617461,0.064819999,0.856562495,,,,nagative,neutral,,nagative

I'm not worried about the Arabisation. I do worry about the lack of self reflection,  critical thinking and tendency to be easily manipulated by superstition or propaganda among Maldivians today which I think are bigger problems. 

I didn't have the words for it for a long time but I sometimes feel like a guy whose never seen his reflection in a mirror when it comes to our cultural identity and history and I reckon many ordinary  Maldivians feel the same.",1,1,2022-12-22 11:11:47 UTC,0,thedrifter129,zseqd9,t1_j183e61,483,FALSE,True,maldives,0.010813263,0.947999418,0.041187249,0.017664241,0.670717001,0.311618745,0.00315542,0.925702095,0.07114251,nagative,negative,neutral,nagative
