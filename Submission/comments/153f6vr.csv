3,jsk9pbf,"Few, but none of them happend in Maldives.

Let's see,
At Lanka. On the 3rd day there ,was stuck in traffic at a busy junction. Just barely got out of the traffic to enter a building at the other corner of the junction.
After 3 mins goin inside. Whole building shook like there was an earthquake and a loud noise deafening my hearing. Stuck in position heart beating like it would pop out. Didn't know what was going on. Untill I got out after a few mins to see whole junction in smokes lots of vehicles parts in debris and far off where exactly we were stuck  4 mins before it happened  there were pools....... Hmm well just say not a sight one would ever wanna see or experiance ever in their life . And the realisation just 4 mins ,just 4 mins and it would have been end of me.  

.. well after this met with 2 other blast at very close proximity. To realise and feel the impact of the blasts. But never got as scared as tht first time. Last two there were no casualties.

And don't worry these were long long back. Since the war is over. Nothing like this could be there. Even then it was pretty safe mostly. Only my luck was on good and bad terms. Unable to decide. ðŸ˜…",3,0,2023-07-19 07:47:10 UTC,0,bonbenzo,153f6vr,t3_153f6vr,1172,False,False,maldives

5,jsn4qub,Saw some guys get stabbed and absolutely beaten to shit by a gang. A buddy and me were having coffee at Dolphin. These guys were at the table next over. Whole thing didn't take a minute and ended with 2 of the guys out with a pool of blood around one's head (the other fell behind the table so I didn't see what state he was in). The third was sat on the wall with blood spurting in bursts from his arm. We immediately paid the bill and bolted. Those were violent days and you didn't want to get mixed up in any of that.,4,0,2023-07-19 21:00:13 UTC,0,jjsameer,153f6vr,t3_153f6vr,520,False,False,maldives
6,jsket66,"Okay this happened when I was very little so I barely remember the details. But back in 2002 all the cub scouts from all schools in MalÃ© had this huge trip. My brother went on the trip. While he was on the trip, we got news a kid drowned and they were cancelling the trip and bringing the kids back. My brother was okay but we didn't get the news untill a few hours later.",3,0,2023-07-19 08:55:08 UTC,0,ProfOfIllogicalLogic,153f6vr,t3_153f6vr,372,False,False,maldives
