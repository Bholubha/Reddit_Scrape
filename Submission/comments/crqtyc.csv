On the other hand, every Maldivian island has made such use of their reef, Male did it only on a larger scale, and the corals were in good shape and receovered quicly unti an exogenous factor did the killing. I came to think, if Male and all the other islands were been absolutely respectful of nature and reefs, if never a brik was to be made out of coral, if every single diver never touched a reef with the tip of their fins, still in the  unprecedented 3 years of global coral bleaching, 2014–2017, the same outcome would have occurred. The same. It gives a strong lesson on necessity to stand united as a planet aganist climate change: the virtuosity of the single means nothing if left alone.",4,0,2019-08-18 05:32:12 UTC,0,TensorMaster,crqtyc

3,exco6jk,It’s a shame in my opinion though that this was knocked down... it was a beautiful house to grow up in and it felt like losing a bit of the old culture when it was knocked down.,3,1,2019-08-18 19:10:47 UTC,0,sofierylala,crqtyc
4,exco3o8,Not this house sadly. It was so beautiful but was knocked down in the early 2000s.,2,1,2019-08-18 19:09:49 UTC,1,sofierylala,crqtyc
