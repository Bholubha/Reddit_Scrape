Majority of motorcycle drivers you see will cut the oncoming lane to turn into a road, sometimes even cut into the wrong side of the road way before the turn - save some time cut the traffic right. It’s all connected - enforcement needs reform, policy needs reform and AWARENESS needs reform - most people don’t realize how dangerous the way they drive are.",7,0,2023-08-21 11:12:02 UTC,0,dashingsymbols,15x4526,t3_15x4526,459,False,False,maldives
1,jx4wzsy,"I wish these newer places like Hulhumale were designed to be more walkable. All the infrastructure is being geared towards forcing/encouraging people to use motor vehicles. Maldives is already South Asia's fattest country and childhood obesity is on the rise, yet we keep designing streets that are increasingly unsafe to walk in. And the more people drive, the higher the number of psycho drivers who have little to no regard for rules and regulations. This is a sad fact.

Walkable streets is definitely a workable concept. Just look at Vilimale.",4,0,2023-08-21 14:34:26 UTC,1,BudovicLagman,15x4526,t3_15x4526,548,False,False,maldives
2,jx4z8p5,"The rise of obesity is truly sad. Access to junk food combined with our high carb diet and sedentary lifestyle and other bad habits such as smoking and betel nuts. I won't be surprised if the test levels of men are falling off the cliff like the rest of the world maybe even worse.

Walkable cities are definitely the future. Some European cities and American cities are creating walking only or walking/biking areas. Makes sense for small islands like ours. It's less than 2km we can walk.",3,1,2023-08-21 14:48:55 UTC,0,r3dxm,15x4526,t1_jx4wzsy,490,False,True,maldives
