2,jw9itbp,"The Maldives was a British protectorate between 1887 till 1965. The 1st picture is from 1903, so if I may be so bold to assume, it is most likely that the Brits took this picture for the sake of documentation of their overseas territories at the time. Thus, it is now being held in UK's National Archives for preservation of historical evidence/artefacts.",7,1,2023-08-15 09:54:16 UTC,2,Zestyclose-Speed-370,15rhfgm
