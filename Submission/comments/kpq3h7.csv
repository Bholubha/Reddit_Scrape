1,ghzkbcw,"Something that's been going on for a while. It's very surprising to see this is actually a polarising issue though, some ppl actually seem to be in favour of this! Actually it's not very surprising. This is the Maldives after all",4,0,2021-01-03 20:00:27 UTC,8,CLICKMVSTER,kpq3h7
2,gi19qv2,"Absolutely nothing happened when the Chinese workers in Maldives did this around 2016 or 2017. But they weren't caught red-handed like this. 

Maldives didn't even ban shark fishing before 2020. It was a 10-year blanket restriction on a number of atolls set in 1998. Luckily there's a new regulation that came into force in August this year, and hopefully the Prosecutor General's Office can do something this time.",3,0,2021-01-04 04:17:37 UTC,0,paradiserythm,kpq3h7
