2,gi19qv2,"Absolutely nothing happened when the Chinese workers in Maldives did this around 2016 or 2017. But they weren't caught red-handed like this. 

Maldives didn't even ban shark fishing before 2020. It was a 10-year blanket restriction on a number of atolls set in 1998. Luckily there's a new regulation that came into force in August this year, and hopefully the Prosecutor General's Office can do something this time.",5,0,1609733857.0,0,paradiserythm
