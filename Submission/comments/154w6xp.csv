0,jstsq1e,"It could very well be a contributing factor but I think how one is raised is far more important. I have been renting my whole life, but I am the kind of person who tries to bring even an empty bottle home so that I can put it in my dustbin. I also dis-agree that people don't litter in their own houses, you will be surprised at just how filthy some places are.

I think it's mainly a matter of the collective culture, and also a bit of the broken window theory from sociology. Which states that existing signs of anti social behavior encourages further anti-social behavior. 

The idea here being that litter/dirt attracts more dirt. Even I have been guilty of this sometimes. If I see a pile of rubbish on the street it is easy to think my additional bottle or tissue paper won't make a difference. And this is also kind of apparent if you go to a lot of islands outside the greater male' area. Where you have garbage free beaches or streets. They still litter there to an extent too. But people will rarely want to be the first guy to spoil a pristine beach or street, so they will chuck it into the trees XD (which is still bad and where the idea of littering being culturally acceptable comes in)

And of course another issue is the lack of public bins. In like most other countries I have been in, you can easily find public bins to put in simple garbage like wrappers or bottles, but not here. And there is a reason for this too. When that was tried it was either destroyed or people just dumb in household waste that rots and destroys or just stuff they don't want to take to the dump. So again culture playing in.

We definitely do need to punish people who litter. Properly punishing, and enforcing such punishments and yes even shaming people for littering definitely would go a long way towards changing this culture. Those that don't litter in their own houses but do in public, do so because at home they will face consequences. Been forced to clean up or been yelled at by those who have to clean up after them. Whereas if you face no consequences for doing it in public they will just keep doing it.",9,0,2023-07-21 04:45:08 UTC,0,crimson_solace,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,2115,False,False,maldives
1,jstp90m,"I have lived in an apartment building in Male' where the tenants of other floors would throw away trash and spit into the stairwell. (Stairwell finishing wasn't done, so it was cement walls and all). 

Let's not discount bad parenting.  We really need to admit that turning 18 doesn't make  ANYONE ready for parenting. 
I'm not calling anyone a BAD parent, just that when you're a kid bringing up another kid.. you just miss out on a lot of things.",3,0,2023-07-21 04:11:19 UTC,0,Familiar_Reality425,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,448,False,False,maldives
2,jsuh2i0,"Personally, I have never been someone who litters, so I never really understood why anyone could litter. However, I did read a lot about it, and like it was mentioned in a previous comment, your theory could be one of the factors. 

A lack of bins is also certainly comtributing factor. This issue mostly ties in with city planning I suppose. Finding public waste disposal areas in the Malé and Hulhumalé certainly is quite the task. 

However, some people just choose to litter even when bins are nearby. Again, as mentioned in a previous comment, littering has become so prevalent in our society that we feel our own littering won't contribute much to the issue. Or some people probably just don't care about it. 

Like you mentioned, passing legislature regarding littering and proper enforcement could encourage people not to litter. We tend to pass a lot of bills and introduce a lot of new laws here, but the laws are usually not enforced very well. So, there's that as well. 

I also think that we can incentivize not littering by rewarding people who don't litter. Like how some countries pay a certain amount of money when you return plastic bottles and other waste products.",3,0,2023-07-21 09:44:57 UTC,0,CarelessNightingale,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,1184,False,False,maldives
3,jsubefs,"It wasn't as bad during the Qayoom regime. Man kept the city clean somewhat, I'll give him that. My take as to why Male' is getting so trashy is because of poor city planning and poor infrastructure to deal with urbanisation. The government is just piss poor  in its management and at leadership to provide a wise solution for the problem at hand.",2,0,2023-07-21 08:27:53 UTC,0,Miffuuuu,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,347,False,False,maldives
4,jstf6re,That is an interesting take and yeah we need some kind of punishment for people to abstain from littering,1,0,2023-07-21 02:42:02 UTC,0,burgerman000,154w6xp,t3_154w6xp,105,False,False,maldives
