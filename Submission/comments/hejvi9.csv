0,fvthvv1,"Great suggestions! I‚Äôve been to both, and they attract two very different types of guests. Jani is for the Instagram/influencer crowd, plus the sexy celebrities.  Beautiful place, but it‚Äôs a 2-5 day experience for me.  Fushi is more like old money, subdued luxury, more private, family friendly. I could stay at Fushi for a month if my bank account and job responsibilities would permit it.  I also recommend Gili Lakanfushi (another Soneva property about 10 years ago).",4,0,1592972031.0,0,fakeit-makeit
1,fvtnosf,Soneva is a favorite for so many reasons! Soneva Jani for the endless cerulean blues and incredible villas over an endless lagoon. Soneva Fushi has an amazing on island experience with forested beach villas.,3,0,1592976151.0,1,Craiggem
