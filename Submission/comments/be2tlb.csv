1,el2sjhe,"Dholhiyadhoo Island. The resort was never finished, and was left in disrepair. There are four caretakers who live there now. Some of my IG followers found the report from Bank of Maldives where the property was sold recently for $45M ish. The construction was abandoned at least 7 years ago.",4,1,2019-04-17 03:56:02 UTC,2,admiralamy,be2tlb,t1_el2qphi,291,False,True,maldives

Two weeks ago I visited Madoogali, where a resort has been abandoned about 4 years ago.   
It seems that the Maldivian institutions revoked the license because the property didn't want to invest in structural improvements.",1,1,2019-05-06 00:24:45 UTC,1,ami-co,be2tlb,t1_el2qphi,248,False,False,maldives
