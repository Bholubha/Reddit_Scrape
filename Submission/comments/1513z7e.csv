0,js6mey7,Many people have tried. Like a lot. The government keeps putting a stop to it every single time. I used to be in an unofficial NGO that worked towards that. I've met a couple of people who tried to do it on their own too. It's always the boomer government getting in the way.,7,0,2023-07-16 12:39:21 UTC,2,q1t0,1513z7e

2,js6n8it,"Maybe some rich cat lover should buy a small island nd make it for cats. With vets nd stuff. Like employees nd maybe ppl can visit with a fee. So emplyees get paid. 

Why r rich pp so greedy!",2,0,2023-07-16 12:47:18 UTC,4,Oddly31,1513z7e
3,js8oc4b,People have tried trust me. The government is lying every single time. And it’s honestly a lot of money that a lot of normal people  ALREDY that r struggling can’t afford to come up w together cuz let’s be realistic about how much it is even to afford to take care of one cat in this Economy.,2,0,2023-07-16 21:24:55 UTC,0,Fenfolhi,1513z7e
4,js8x5qi,"The only viable solution is neutering them and releasing it. And people should think long and hard about undertaking the responsibility of keeping any pets , it shouldn’t be like an impulse buy.",2,0,2023-07-16 22:29:32 UTC,1,Maakanaa,1513z7e

6,js6mur6,"why does the government get in the way? like what is the official reason?

I feel like it's a good thing to give the cats like a sanctuary since all they are doing right now is eat trash and get sick. I'll be honest I've seen a few cats just dead, laying on the ground..not only is this sad for the cats but also unhygienic for the people living here, just spreads disease",1,1,2023-07-16 12:43:33 UTC,0,burgerman000,1513z7e
7,js8aelq,Well said. The government do be like that.,1,1,2023-07-16 19:49:32 UTC,0,CarelessNightingale,1513z7e
8,js6nmah,"True! plus even if it is not a chairty case, they or the government can do the same by making it like some sort of tourist destination or even built vet places there and let people work there, where you can bring your cat to see em! 

I know that my brother in law has been wanting to send his cat to the vet but he is waiting to be on the waiting list",1,1,2023-07-16 12:50:54 UTC,2,burgerman000,1513z7e
9,js9zm4j,"This is something which crosses my mind too, like there are  cat sanctuary islands around the world which has become tourist destinations. It would be a different concept than the resorts currently in Maldives but it is definitely something which can be done. But the government does not want to find a solution to the problem, the stay cats in Male', Hulhumale and Villingili needs a safe haven. But the reality is that most Maldivians do not care about anything else other than them.",1,1,2023-07-17 03:40:12 UTC,0,Outrageous-Cat-1391,1513z7e
10,jsa0176,I think one of the reasons why the stray population increased so much is that the so called cat lovers were breeding their cats and ended up releasing them out to the street once they got bored or something. So many domesticated cats are released after a while when they get sick or old. People like that should not own cats let alone any other type of pets.,3,1,2023-07-17 03:44:08 UTC,0,Outrageous-Cat-1391,1513z7e

12,js6yx2y,they don't deserve to just die tho,2,1,2023-07-16 14:25:45 UTC,0,burgerman000,1513z7e
13,js6tpll,"""waiting to be on the waiting list""

One of the saddest things in Maldives for pet owners. We definitely need more vets.",2,2,2023-07-16 13:44:41 UTC,1,ProfOfIllogicalLogic,1513z7e
14,js7atm0,iam just saying its not worth spending money on these cats. the owners disowned them after they grow up. those who love them so much should take them into their homes instead of feeding them outside. Putting them down humanley is also done in many countries,-1,2,2023-07-16 15:51:21 UTC,2,Package_Some,1513z7e
15,js6tygk,"whats even crazy is they were like ""wait for a week and will put you on the waiting list"" and when he calls a week later they still haven't been able to put the cat on the wait list",1,3,2023-07-16 13:46:39 UTC,0,burgerman000,1513z7e
16,js7lw5p,Yeah but cat lovers would riot and nothing would be accomplished sry for being aggro in the first comment but there isnt a safe solution for maldives if a shelter isnt built,2,3,2023-07-16 17:05:14 UTC,0,Toastedpaan,1513z7e
17,jsao4gr,Your perspective that human lives are worth more than any other is the real issue that needs to be killed. There's always a way to live WITH nature. Not kill it.,1,3,2023-07-17 08:28:57 UTC,0,Familiar_Reality425,1513z7e
