2,gne4l3c,"Sadly no. Yeah though the lifestyle was minimal and basic, it sure seems better and less chaotic. My point was that maldives is still at its prime and though we as a country want to embrace a modern society our thought and cognitive reasoning are still far behind.",2,1,2021-02-14 12:24:51 UTC,2,merduc,lj0az4

5,gnhmmv6,"Although I agree with you about the 'reasoning' on some level, I think your overall assessment might be a bit unfair to the people of MV that are out in front. 

Maldives can punch above its weight in terms of art and design and I think you have some design leaders in your country. For example, Ooredoo recently released a calendar designed by Maldivian company 'publicity bureau' with very cool AR tech embedded. I haven't seen anyone else doing that as well as them. 

There are many societal and political reasons that are holding MV back, but I reckon all the building blocks are there for MV to embrace modern society.",4,2,2021-02-15 01:46:32 UTC,1,krishna_p,lj0az4
6,gnhorz6,"I agree. It wasn’t any way an insult to the great stuff we have going on. Still my point remains the same that our society at large remains majorly, not people like you and me but majorly at a far behind comprehension level than what could be called a modern mentality. And politically the parties (all of them) could feed those people any sorta crap and they would take it. BUT people like you and me and many more out there doing great stuff cant be taken by their words now say amen and lets go have a great day.",6,3,2021-02-15 02:06:48 UTC,0,merduc,lj0az4
