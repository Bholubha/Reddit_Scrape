21,jrwnz9i,"to be fair, while I would appreciate more posts about things other than resorts, I don't think shutting down anything to do with resorts is the best way. let them be, but we should just talk about other topics by ourselves instead. it's not that there are too many resort posts, just that there isn't enough of anything else.",8,1,2023-07-14 07:20:50 UTC,1,antheiakasra,14z6nnb

27,js0r4r4,"It's totally true. But I don't think anything will change in the next 10 years. 

I call this current leadership generation the 'survivors generation'. These people will stop at nothing to get money and materials, and they will use their family and religion to justify their greed.

These are the people who had to 'fight' their siblings and everyone else to come out on top. 

I feel that this is the outcome of our grandparents and great grand parents pushing out kids at both ends of the year without really understanding what parenting is.",1,1,2023-07-15 02:55:41 UTC,1,Familiar_Reality425,14z6nnb
28,js37r3s,"I think there are a lot of things that will need to change before things get better in that sense.

For one thing let me talk about the general public for a moment. Even though we call ourselves a Republic I do not believe our collective consciousness has truly embraced or understood the idea of a Republic or a Democracy. 

And this is ingrained on a cultural level starting from the royalty and the psuedo democracy that replaced that with beyfulhun's. Let us take a look at our language for one thing. In democracies we have leaders, not rulers. But to us we have only verin. Verin is the word for rulers, leaders and even owners. I am the verimeeha of the property I own. I should not be the verimeeha of people I am meant to lead.

And this mentality can be seen when you really think about it. We elect people, but then have this expectation that if the president/minister etc wants something to happen that should happen. That if you have a problem they should immediately be able to fix it by telling people to do so. And are upset when that does not happen. But that's not how democracies or leaderships work. That is how rulers rule. 

And then we have all these councils and commissions, where by law the president of such does not have an exceedingly great authority over the rest of its members. They are meant to work as a group, with the president leading and been the focal point. But what ends up is this culture of verimeeha makes the whole thing into whatever he/she wants happens. 

Ofcourse I do not really believe this is the general public's fault. It's just our ingrained culture we have yet been unable to change.",1,1,2023-07-15 17:33:04 UTC,0,crimson_solace,14z6nnb

31,jrxkulx,"Well, since you want controversy, I'll just give my two cents on the Rilwan case. I'm just gonna say I don't think it is unsolved at all. I think cases with political influence tend to go this way. Most of our mainstream media channels are super polarized and pretty much just propagate political bullshit. Also, I noticed a lot of the articles have spelling mistakes, but tbh I get it, Dhivehi is super hard to type.",6,2,2023-07-14 13:25:03 UTC,0,CarelessNightingale,14z6nnb
32,jrx6adh,I do like this idea. But it's hard to imagine a real conversation being carried out without personal bombardment. I think us maldivians are hard to educate. Even to talk about disagreements in a civil manner.,3,2,2023-07-14 11:17:39 UTC,1,Familiar_Reality425,14z6nnb
33,jrwxbie,"Not related to his case or your post. Rilwan was part of the old Maldivian blogosphere. I didn't know his name back then, he was known by his pseudonym ""moyameeha"". I wasn't an active part of the community, I only found out his name years later after his disappearance. 

I think one of the first blog article I recall from him was one about how the justice system let's away pedophiles, abusers and rapists. Probably sometime around 2008. I think his old articles are still online.",2,2,2023-07-14 09:28:27 UTC,2,z80lives,14z6nnb

41,js55eix,"My uncle, and dad both were fishermen in their early youth. Moved to Male and gave it up. Uncle because his health failed him, (he died of lung cancer, smoked two packs daily). Uncle would go out any chance he could get on a small outrigger and once caught a Marlin that he had to lash to the boat. Both brothers were taught by my grandfather, who (according to them) would take out a canoe and use a handmade spear to fish, sometimes tying his feet to the boat and jumping after the fish. No engines, no big sails or equipment, no safety. Just by himself. He would fish this way close to the island, but sometimes would get way out, following a catch. Bear in mind this is way before the modern vessels came. When a friend later passed me the book ‚Äòthe old man and the sea,‚Äô I thought. Hey that‚Äôs about my Uncle.",3,3,2023-07-16 02:30:42 UTC,1,Sh4uki,14z6nnb
