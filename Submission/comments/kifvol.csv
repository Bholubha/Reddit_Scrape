17,gh3gvq0,"Oh, okay! I have few more questions:

1. Aren't ferry/speed boat services available only during day time? Can I visit this place at night and return on the same day without having to stay in that island?
2. Actually I found atleast 3 places named Vaadhoo (it has confused me), which one are you talking about?
3. Which other islands can we see this bioluminescent phytoplankton?

Thanks!",1,2,2020-12-26 19:28:57 UTC,1,_PurpleJellyfish_,kifvol

19,j3fx0ug,"I just got back from the Maldives and saw the bioluminescent plankton. Very very cool! The locals said it isn‚Äôt a very common experience.

As for using the seaplane, you‚Äôre right that they don‚Äôt fly at night, so you either have to be gone on the last flight of the day, which is around 3:30pm, or you have to stay til the next day.",2,3,2023-01-08 07:14:45 UTC,0,Hip_Girl,kifvol
