0,j18ahd9,"I don't claim to understand the Maldivian predicament but from my pov we don't have any sorta national identity. We just have a placeholder religious identity masquerading as the national identity.

The moment we are granted religious freedom, we would lose any sort of coherence among us and we would cease to exist as a country. Like for real when was the last time all Maldivians were of the same mind about anything?",6,0,2022-12-22 12:03:50 UTC,0,CapnHanSolo,zseqd9
1,j1c561i,"Thereâ€™s a lot of sense in what OP is trying to say but unfortunately I donâ€™t think that we can overcome this issue in the near future as there could be several factors contributing to this targeted xenophobia. 

I think that weâ€™re stuck in an odd yet hopeful juncture; modern vs traditional. The former being predominant among among Gen Z, lower age group from Millennials and the latter ideology and customs being distributed highly among Gen X and older millennials. This affects how each of these groups perceive and accept societal and cultural norms as well as see the flaws and areas for improvement. To put it short: itâ€™s the young ones who can break this chain of bias and bigotry. 

As for how we Maldivians treat foreigners: be it tourists or expatriates, you donâ€™t have to look far to understand this elitism or sense of superiority (MalÃ© vs non-MalÃ© inhabitants/residents). When we view fellow countrymen and women from different parts of the country as inferior, how can we treat citizens of different nationalities with equality? Sad truth is the people of this country is a prime example of Dunning-Kruger effect and superiority complexes everywhere. 

Then thereâ€™s the political element. Remember the herd mentality prevalent among Maldivians. Sheeple indeed. Weâ€™re stuck at a challenging position when it comes to geo politics. Depending on the leader, bilateral relations and alliances vary and as such today it might be pro-India, tomorrow pro-China and so on. So whatever (mis)information and propaganda is directed from the top is what comes down to the average citizen as well. 

Personally, I feel we should accept each and every country with the same kindness and hospitality regardless of nationality; especially seeing how dependent we are on tourism and mostly because itâ€™s the decent thing to do!",3,0,2022-12-23 05:12:23 UTC,0,Grobyx,zseqd9

Anyway, since you are discussing about what 'Maldivians' think of themselves, I got some things to add. 

I think, what we now think of as modern Maldivian identity and nationalism emerged mid 20th century forged by the ruling class of the time. History was revised; it was no longer a persian but a moroccan who was buried in the central shrine. 

Hussein Salahuddin sanitized the Boduthakurufaanu story (compared to Buraara koi) and further framed it as an anti-colonial struggle. It was previously framed as a religious and political struggle by Hassan Tajuddin in the 18th century manuscript. 

Somewhere over time the local form of Sufi Islam became part of the culture and eventually after several religious reformations it was superceded by a more mainstream Islam. Before that,  based on few lines of the surviving copperplate from 13th century (Kudahuvadhoo) it looks like early Maldivian Islam was a localised form of the religion with syncretic elements.

Maybe a large part of our current problem is that the dichotomy between religion and culture was never properly addressed by Maldivians themselves. The common perception is that Islam was introduced in 12th CE as it was practiced until the early 20th. However, if you look at the written records it is evidently false, there was a lot of persecutions; both religious and political and over time what we now think of as Dhivehi identity emerged. 


My point is, we have to understand that 'Dhivehi' culture itself has evolved a lot over time and it's likely going to keep changing like any other culture. The best we can do is to reflect and try to understand how we came here.


p.s: Maldivians have been fetishizing/emulating Arabs and Persians atleast for 5 centuries. However, our religious words and concepts are still rooted in borrowed Sanskrit phrases inherited from the Buddhist traditions.  Until the 19th century our word for God was Dheyvatha. Five century was a long time, so I wouldn't worry about Arabisation of Dhivehi culture within the next 100 years.",7,0,2022-12-22 10:33:50 UTC,2,z80lives,zseqd9

I had a similar experience while I was visiting the Maldives. I found many people had a great deal of respect and admiration for the European and Arab cultures, but at the same time, the same cultures shared some of the same values which I had seen in other parts of Asia, such as the importance of family and mental health. It's interesting to see how the culture is adapting to modern times, but at the same time, retaining some of the traditional values which have been passed down for centuries.",2,0,2023-03-16 02:10:26 UTC,0,amy_mighty_travels,zseqd9

6,j18qmu3,"That's a deep reflection. What can I do to learn more about authentic Dhivehi culture (not influenced by Islam or colonialism)?

PS: I'll be visiting the country as a solo traveler soon and I'd like to learn also about the local culture. The traditional Dhivehi writing looks really cool.",2,1,2022-12-22 14:32:24 UTC,0,BroodingShark,zseqd9
7,j1867ss,"Thanks for the reply. 

I'm not worried about the Arabisation. I do worry about the lack of self reflection,  critical thinking and tendency to be easily manipulated by superstition or propaganda among Maldivians today which I think are bigger problems. 

I didn't have the words for it for a long time but I sometimes feel like a guy whose never seen his reflection in a mirror when it comes to our cultural identity and history and I reckon many ordinary  Maldivians feel the same.",1,1,2022-12-22 11:11:47 UTC,0,thedrifter129,zseqd9

9,j1c5xs6,"So sorry that you and your wife had a bad experience here. I hope it is of some comfort that not all of us are assholes and in the fact that we do acknowledge the issues going on here. And I know a good many people who would, along with me, feel ashamed of the experience you had to go through. 

I lived in India for over 5 years when I was growing up and have had several different experiences ranging from good to horrifying. However, the good far outweighs the bad, unlike in your experience here.",2,1,2022-12-23 05:19:47 UTC,0,Grobyx,zseqd9
