0,jv05rpu,"If you’re looking for a healthy option to do take away I love “Meer.food” their chicken fajita bowl is amazing but has hints of sweet and tangy as well so might not be for everyone’s palette. 

For sushi Sushi Zu was an absolutely amazing one but the main chef changed I think so it wasn’t as good as before when we went last time. But the mango and coconut dessert they had was still very good. 

Can’t think of more right now but will add if I remember anything else",3,0,2023-08-06 07:40:49 UTC,4,islandtravel,15jh5ts

2,jv06dwj,"1. som tam Thai. Used to be previously called ""chim Thai "". Too as OP mentioned it is a owned by older Maldivian and Thai couple..I can second what OP says. Even the prices are reasonable. 


Recently tried KFZ- korean food zone  at hulhumale.  It is run by a Korean lady. Cute personality and creates the vibe and feel of a Korean place. And the food is authentic  . Thou might be just slightly a little high end on the pricing. It is worth for the experience.


As for symphony and  Italian dishes. Hmmm well they are too Maldivianized. At this point.  Yeah I understand cannot serve most Italian dishes due to halal. But can keep to the concept the theme of the original dish. 
For instance carbonara base of the dish is 
- Cured pork cheeks /pancetta 
- egg/egg yolks 
- parmesan/ pecorino

So why not just replace the cured meat with a halal beef based cured meat. Still this will not change the base of the dish. Which is even a served variant  in Italy to ppl who eat halal.

But here mostly it's take aways the eggs. Adds cream/ milk, Bell pepper. Cheddar cheese. Cream cheese parsley leafs . It is all a mushy mess.

11,jv09y04,Seagull and Family Room are great. Can you recommend a place for valhomas koththu or noodles? Basically anything valhomas.,1,1,2023-08-06 08:36:46 UTC,1,primary0,15jh5ts

13,jv0dla0,Yeah but since they asked specifically about dining I didn’t talk about them much. If I’m doing take away that’s definitely my go to place.,2,2,2023-08-06 09:26:23 UTC,0,islandtravel,15jh5ts
14,jx8g8pm,Glad you liked it. Oishii also opened their new place and I have heard good reviews but haven’t been there yet. Used to be the best sushi in town when they were in Hulhumale’ but quality went down a bit in their second place and need to try and see how it is now.,1,2,2023-08-22 05:05:19 UTC,0,islandtravel,15jh5ts
