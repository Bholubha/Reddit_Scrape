0,e5y5fgh,I dream every single day of getting back. Truly have never been happier than when I was there.,3,0,2018-09-14 04:13:06 UTC,1,Sultry_Comments,9fkuv0
1,e5y84hr,"I can understand how you feel. I’m from the tropics and we do have a few of the best beaches in the world however the Maldives just gives me a different feeling each time we’re there. Not to sound cheesy but being with someone you truly love and be able to enjoy the majestic beauty of the islands makes it more memorable. 

Like you, not a day goes by that I didn’t wish I was just listening to the serenity and looking out to the vastness of the ocean.",1,1,2018-09-14 05:13:40 UTC,0,eavevee,9fkuv0
