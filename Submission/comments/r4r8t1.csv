3,hqwufmf,"Hi Faru,

 Probably overthinking this, but what is accepted as booking confirmation for the accomodation/resort at Border Control?

We have an itinerary outlining dates of our stay and an email from the resort confirming that they're expecting us. Does this suffice or is a formal confirmation from our travel agent required? It is a bank holiday in the UK tomorrow and the travel agent will reopen after our arrival.

Thank you",2,0,2022-01-02 07:52:24 UTC,1,Blocoholi,r4r8t1

A lot of packages have unlimited. I unfortunately cannot advise you on the cost for GB but the speed and bandwidth have no problem. I use a monthly paid plan for my use, I think the tourist packages would be different.   


Hotel staff are generally individuals so, basic human psychology works. My favorite guests are the ones who ask me about my day, my life and get to know me a bit. My least favourite guests are ones who just see me as someone to ask for services.",4,1,2021-11-29 09:50:42 UTC,4,,r4r8t1

25,hmmal5b,"Mostly yes!   


Rarely, if an island is under monitoring status, then no. Monitoring means the island is under strict monitoring due to possible outbreak.   


Most islands are covid free and if the island has an outbreak, it's best to change your booking to another island anyway - if your booking is refundable.   


Most booking websites have a new Force Majeure policy that allows you to claim a refund if it's not possible to visit or stay due to COVID related reasons.",1,1,2021-11-30 03:30:18 UTC,0,,r4r8t1

30,hmry81u,"I do agree that is an outrageous price! Well, it is free for citizens of Maldives by the government but just by the sheer volume of tests that need to be done for tourists it has created a demand for private labs to start covid testing, so now the tourists get only the private labs covid testing, and I hear there is a lot of costs involved in this (the testing machine, the transferring of samples)   


Maafushi is a local island quite close to Male' and still it's 50 USD here, which is among the cheapest. It used to be 100 USD around this time last year when we first re opened our borders.   


Yes, you can give a call to Treetop Hospital at Hulhumale, or ADK Hospital in Male' however it would not be free. But definitely not 130!!   


Also the 72hr PCR rule only applies if you stayed at a local inhabited island such as Guraidhoo, Gulhi, Thulusdhoo, Thinadhoo, Maafushi, Ukulhas so on so forth but not if you have stayed at a private island resort.

Tipping is NOT customary in our culture and we do not expect it.
