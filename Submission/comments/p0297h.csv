0,h8509nn,"I’ve spoken to many locals when there, and not all resorts and situations are created equal. I even saw a French TV report recently and it featured my local dive master / buddy. He was born on an island that is 10 mins away, so he could commute daily if conditions were horrendous, he chooses to live on the island. He earns a salary that wouldn’t be nearly horrible by western standards. I’m from the EU and I think it’s about 4 times our minimum wage. The dude who cleaned our rooms spoke very good English and he said he’d been cleaning the same 5 rooms for 25 years now. If it were such a horrible place to work he could’ve easily gone elsewhere with his level of English. I also heard that for some foods the crew get their own kind (like rice is cheaper rice from India) but for most of the things it’s the same as guests, for example there are cold cuts and bread out all day for the crew and anyone can make themselves sandwiches without any limits at any time. Keep in mind this is food they serve to people like Tom Hardy, the A list actor (it’s his favorite hotel).

The only thing unusual by western standards (albeit not that part of the world and esp not muslim countries), is that different people have different rights, but strangely enough the locals have the fewest. So they can’t drink alcohol or have pork in the resorts even if it’s available to staff for example. Things of that nature. 

I realize I only saw a slice, but when our waiter told us he earns plenty to make a living for his entire family and he gets more time off than we westerners do and he takes his family to one of many nice local islands for a beach vacation, I was actually somewhat envious. Nature is the same for everyone obviously. 

I know this might not be the standard, baseline and I am told this is one of the most “local centric” hotels in the entire country (even some of top management is local), but I don’t feel bad when I go there, I know that my money is definitely make a positive impact on the locals’ lives as well as being a minimal burden on the environment (they bottle their own water in glass, they sort the garbage vehemently, they have an incinerator, etc.). 

The hotel is called Lily Beach.

Edit:
Here is the report

And I checked he earns 5.1 times our minimum wage a month… again, EU country.",8,0,2021-08-08 05:17:58 UTC,0,TheeOxygene,p0297h
1,h85fphf,"Maldives had a change of government since 2018, the current government is more liberal and left-leaning compared to the more repressive government of Yameen Abdul Qayoom.  From what I recall, the ex-president of the Maldives was sentenced for 5 years for embezzlement few years ago. 

Last time Maldives had politically motivated internet censorship was back in the early 2000s when I was a teenager under Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's regime. While there are no internet censorship laws, I think there have been few cases where politicians abuse anti-defamation laws. I think people can get in trouble for making death threats to politicians. There's a lot about local politics and the progress of human rights issues since 2008 reforms, which I cannot summarise here in one post. 

Ever since the Maldives Independent and Minivan news shut down, you'll find fewer english language news outlets that does political analysis. But if you google, you may find some english language news outlets that are politically neutral.

As for the resorts, I recall a post in this subbreddit of a resort owner that was caught exploiting the local ecosystem. I think it is a good idea to boycott such resorts. You have to remember that Maldives is around 1000 small coral islands, and only 185 of them have local population. Just about 4 of them are considered as population centers. Resort owners can in practice disregards the local laws protecting the environment without any consequences.

You are right that most Maldivians probably do not experience Maldives as tourists do. Speaking from my own experience, I've never been to a resort and do not like the ocean but I've always appreciated the fact tourism rejuvenated the local economy in the 70s. 

Most social problems in the country have nothing to do with tourism. Before it became a republic, 'Maldives' was an exonym for a very old kingdom which had a centralised fuedal system in place to control their territory. The country became a british protectorate in 1887 because of a complex family rivalry within the ruling dynasty, which ended with one branch consolidating the power with the help of the British.

 From 1940s to late 1950s the kingdom was struggling to keep its territories under control, there were multiple secessionist movements from north and south of the kingdom. Tourism was introduced in 1970s after it became a republic with the same ruling class still holding power. 

Until very recently it was this same class of former nobility which held positions in the government. Even today the endonym for the country 'Dhivehi Raajje' literally means Island Kingdom. (Divehi actually refers to the language and ethnicity of the native islanders, but some scholars translate it to Islanders)",9,0,2021-08-08 08:48:34 UTC,0,z80lives,p0297h
2,h84tab6,"I don't think we're at the point of China and the loving and gentle rule of the CCP, but it's not all sun and shine here either. That said, normal citizens aren't living in constant fear or anything like that. There's the occasional political assassination attempt or someone from the opposing party ending up in jail for the rest of their life but I guess that's pretty common in all countries now. 

I think someone more familiar with local politics can give you a better answer on that.

But for the rest of us - we have the basic stuff. Cost of living is much higher than the average wage. There was that one time a local ISP tried to ban pornhub and their entire customer base revolted. Travellers who only stay at the (hella overpriced) resorts really don't see anything except what's advertised on the brochures.",6,0,2021-08-08 04:02:07 UTC,0,Rekcs,p0297h
3,h86ql4o,"You're talking about 2018. 2018 was a year that we got popular. You know how when bad stuff happen you suddenly get more famous then when the good stuff happen. Coming to 2021, No. We are not suffering at all. We suck at Religious freedom, yes. Political, nah. And we do not have internet censorship. I personally, live very happily and very freely. Although, compared to western standards, our living would be considered ""not good"", but hey, its still better than the rest of South Asia.",4,0,2021-08-08 16:57:33 UTC,0,,p0297h
