0,jv1txuf,"Some of the games I like are very old, from PS1. I like harvest moon back to nature, digimon world 1, 2 and 3 plus digimon card battle, which are all ps1 games, but my fav digimon game is digimon world next order. I like turn based games too like civ games and ff games, especially ff8 but ff15 is my fav game in the ff series. While I'm on ff, I should say I didn't play all the ff games and would like to mention I liked dissidia too. I don't particularly like God of war but still a good game that I did enjoy. I like dmc too, haven't played dmc 1 and 5 yet, 3 has been my fav so far. Also I like the assassin's Creed games, playing unity now and I actually played all the main assassin's Creed games up to unity. For mobile games, the online games I play are mobile legends bang bang and coc, for an offline game I play an indie game called world rumble. Also would like to mention mount and blade 2: bannerlord, while I'm not particularly good in this game I do enjoy it. I did play dark souls but didn't finish it, I would maybe finish them in the future but for now I have other games I want to try more. I also like games like red alert, Warhammer 40k dawn of war, age of empires. For red alert, I liked red alert 2 Yuri's revenge the best and for age of empires, I liked 2 best.

Now there are definitely some games I'm forgetting here. I mostly like single player games with a good story. I don't really like multiplayer games, especially battle royale games.",7,0,2023-08-06 17:05:22 UTC,7,ProfOfIllogicalLogic,15jobmx

9,jv2rjoq,"I haven't played video game more recently, but I used to play a lot. Most of them are a bit older, but I hope you'll enjoy them. I'll list down 10 games that has good replay value.

1. Final Fantasy VI
2. The Sims
3. Mass effect series (- not Andromeda, that's garbage)
4. Super Metroid
5. Castlevania 
6. Fire Emblem any of the GBA games
7. Mother / Earthbound series.
8. Tetris
9. X-Com
10. Elder Scrolls (any game in this series holds up)

I picked ff6, because I played all final fantasy titles progressively till 10 and it is really the best one. Along with Chrono Trigger, Earthbound and Lufia II it's probably the best jrpg of it's time. 

Mass effect, because it has a decent story and good space opera. 

Castlevania and Metroid, has the best gameplay ever designed. Discovered Super Metroid when I wrote a paper on it (about symbolism and narrative) for college assignment (also portal and ""To the moon""), it has a good replay value. 

Fire Emblem; I played to pass time when commuting.
X-COM and battle toad whenever I wanted something challenging, I hate contra and metal slug is way easy.

Tetris, hard to believe for some but probably the best game ever made. I used to write tetris and snake in every new language, emulator or platform I work on. Even wrote one for ""z80lives"", my old partially complete but abandoned z80 based computer emulator suite.  Ironically it's name ""lives"" on as my internet handle.

Also, shout out to cool rpg maker games like, Undertale, Lisa, Yume Nikki and Corpse party.",2,0,2023-08-06 20:52:21 UTC,2,z80lives,15jobmx

Especially Starting from Demons Souls back in 09 every game they released so far has been really enjoyable to play. Bloodborne is my personal favourite video game of all time.

Other series i really like are Uncharted and Gow of war. 

Additionally; 

Liked GTA Sa and GTA 3 ( 4 and 5 not so much lol )

RDR 2 is a masterpiece  ( haven't played 1 )

FF16 and FF7 are excellent as well

Assassin's Creed ( up to syndicate. haven't played anything after that )

Resident Evil (all the recent ones)

Ghost of Tsushima

TLOU 1 ( 2 is utter trash btw )

Dmc ( every main entry apart from dmc 2 is really good)

Prince of Persia sands of time and warrior within ( ahh the nostalgia, really wish Ubisoft would remake these 2 )

 I am a fan of turn based gamed too, really enjoyed persona 5 when it blew me away even though its a turn based game + life simulator lol. The only thing to look out for in DMC1 is underwater combat idk why but whenever there's underwater combat in a video game I just go meh. Ff8 was really nice too I am probably going to play FF9 soon and then go back to FF8.

dark souls I played 3 but I played it so brain dead that I had no idea what I was doing. I was just killing things

I hated world 2's music. It literally makes me sleepy. I know this cuz I tested with sound on and sound off plays but still played it a lot lol. Card battle I did get a 100% completion. I probably played world 3 the most but for the mini card game in it, that was a game on it's own.

I don't think there's much to say about ff. The whole series is very well made and all people now need to do is just pick their favorites. I liked how ff8 had the junction functions. Persona 5 was recommended to me but I haven't gotten around to playing it.

Bayek, the main character, was something else and his story was very compelling and a rollercoaster of emotions such as anger at his enemies, grief for his predicament. A really well-written storyline. Odyssey and Valhalla were also good, both in terms of story and gameplay but mainly if you‚Äôre into history, mythologies and stuff and a lot of combat.
