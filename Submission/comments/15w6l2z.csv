0,jwz6sex,It is a very common and very illegal practice in the Maldives. Try contacting a maldivian law firm.,13,0,2023-08-20 09:26:47 UTC,3,q1t0,15w6l2z

But as someone else mentioned, it is prohibited by the law so contact a law firm.",8,0,2023-08-20 09:45:56 UTC,0,YoloSwaggins77,15w6l2z

4,jx05x1a,"Not the right course of action.  She should contact the consulate office of her country of residence, after filing a police report.  The police report should reflect that her passport has been stolen.  

With the police report, she should obtain a new passport from the consulate of her home country.

5,jx3a3ng,"I second this. It’s high time that companies here learned this lesson the hard way. That said, sometimes the passport process does take a long time and front- line staff usually don’t have the whole picture. Still they should give her a solid answer. Edit: the expat section of immigration is in the process of moving their offices to hulhumale. A long and tedious process.",3,2,2023-08-21 04:22:05 UTC,1,deck_16,15w6l2z

Totally agree.  If this is going on with foreign workers, it's time to get Interpol involved.  The United States Department of State might do that anyway (if the OP's wife is American, and she tells her story).",1,3,2023-08-21 05:09:31 UTC,0,theoryofdoom,15w6l2z
