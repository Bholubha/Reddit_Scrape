This sub has been around for a very long time. It has never had rules about maldivians posting about maldivian issues. It just so happened that only tourists posted on it. That is not the mods fault. And if anything they have maintained it without it becoming a haven for like nsfw posts or scams or what not. It's not their job todo drive up engagement from actual maldivians. And now that this sub has become a bit more active what...we are calling for isthiufa? How very....maldivian. 

That said given that the dynamic of this subreddit is changing perhaps the mods can take it into consideration and implement some changes and they are active. I have seen them ban or warn people of personal adverts and even engage in the comments of recent posts. And also do seem to be maldivian based on their post history. So I am just hoping they are trying to figure out what changes need to be made to make this subreddit better.",7,0,2023-07-23 13:54:17 UTC,5,crimson_solace,157dmhp

2,jt4jv8u,honestly I didn't realise the mods were active that's all! ended up talking with other Maldivian redditors on here who also said they haven't noticed anything so i thought if the mods aren't really here then just give the modding to someone else,2,1,2023-07-23 14:39:49 UTC,2,burgerman000,157dmhp

4,jw8cam4,"I fully agree 100%. Looking at similar subreddits like r/malaysia, this subreddit sadly has not been about the Maldives, but rather, strictly a place where tourists only come for suggestions for to-do activities in the Maldives. 

I'm not saying anything against it at all (and I don't mind that too), but I do believe that the dominant content of this subreddit should be about the Maldivian current affairs, history, and local life.

Glad to see some improvements in posts here recently in this regard.",1,1,2023-08-15 02:24:47 UTC,0,Zestyclose-Speed-370,157dmhp

6,jt4kevy,"Fair. When you said that I checked the mods history. And they do seem to be active. And I have definitely seen a warning from a mod on a post even after things got a bit active here.

And yeah as I said I am with you on that it would be cool if they could expand things a bit now that it's gotten more active.",1,2,2023-07-23 14:43:46 UTC,1,crimson_solace,157dmhp
7,jt4kwhv,"if the mods are around and can actually change things for the better according with the recent activity then it is all for it
