I worked in the reservations department at the four seasons so our work hours were fixed unlike most of the other staff at the resort. I would usually wrap up by 4 every day and be in the water either kayaking or snorkeling. On my days off I went with the resident marine biologist to hanifaru bay of wherever else he went and basically assisted. At night after dinner chilled at the lounge playing pool or video games.

This was my first job out of high school so I was very excited and participated in every single thing I could. Most of the older colleagues just ate and watched movies and talked to their loved ones on the phone. So I guess if you‚Äôre doing only those things you could go crazy after a few months.

jpylkyf,Pay was alright but this was 2010-2011 and it was the four seasons. The food was amazing since it‚Äôs cheaper for the resorts to buy the same ingredients as the guests in bulk. But it‚Äôs a fixed menu that rotates each week so after a few weeks some people do get bored. And yes the food is free at the staff restaurant. I have a few friends that worked in not so fancy resorts that didn‚Äôt have as good an experience so I guess it really depends on where you go. If you have an open mind I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find ways to make the most out of your stay.,4,2,2023-06-29 06:02:56 UTC,0,islandtravel,14lfnpf,t1_jpykw0a,544,FALSE,False,maldives,0.044037964,0.023393076,0.932568967,0.535864949,0.015874345,0.448260665,0.28814739,0.011011172,0.700841427,neutral,positive,neutral,neutral

The Waldorf Astoria Maldives has a private island that you can stay for yourself (by booking the entire island), if I'm not wrong, that is the island shown in the picture. I don't know much about how frequently people book that island. But it's extremely expensive and they provide equal amount of services to match that expense. 

Essentially you will have an entire island to yourself during the stay. You will have a private spa, restaurant, gym etc. You will be isolated from all the other staff and guests.

gn76gt8,"I'm wondering if Luxury does actually make a difference.

Soneva promised to have villas ready for quarantine free of charge alongside On-site PCR testing and on-site lab for results.Considering that Soneva is at 2500 USD a night on active monsoon days and 3000 USD on high-season I wouldn't doubt that this is affordable for Soneva, but too good to believe.

But given that the boat on the article from Kathrin Schuler was redirected I don't really expect that to be possible for similar cases like ""guy on the plane tested positive, whole plane-quarantine..."" or collection boats collecting different ressort-people.

I bet that's just the case if you do the additional 1000 USD plane transfer from Mal√© airport which seems to be completely owned by Soneva. - So if you already had an ultra-luxury travel allowing you to separate.

All travel insurances in Germany are a ""pay first, then get it back later"" insurance. So you often can't have something else than that.

gqpt5dc,"Yeah, completely agreed.

A lot of people just chalk up Maldives to be either island resorts or capital city Mal√©.

The capital is one of the most densely populated places on earth. But its far from all this country has to offer.

An inhabited island has nearly everything a resort has to offer, with actual people and actual culture.

Edit; for all of you that arent aware, Maldives is actually comprised of 1190 fully formed islands, and many more sandbanks and reefs. Mal√© houses a chunk of the nation‚Äôs population, but its not ‚Äòwhere everyone lives‚Äô. Far from it. There‚Äôs also an expat population in Mal√© nearly 1/3 of the entire Maldivian population, so yeah congestion is a major issue here. DO NOT LIVE IN MAL√â!

Before going to the second hotel I need to do another PCR test, but I can't find any information on where to do the PCR test on [Dhiffushi](https://www.google.dk/maps/place/Dhiffushi/@4.4419622,73.7114756,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b3f916d9c4395c5:0x89b05894a4ae0485!8m2!3d4.4401762!4d73.7132147).

\- Split stay is allowed now.

\- The guesthouse/ resorts will be arranging all the formalities associated with split stay for you.

\- you dont need to do PCR test before moving from one island to another. Just need to make sure the islands are not under monitoring list. (in my case the local islands are Maafushi and Fulidhoo).

hj4bgtw,"Hi buddy,

I have contacted the resort (Meeru Island Resort) and unfortunately they require the following:

* NO visiting of local island before coming to the private resort. If you go to a local island, you will NOT be allowed to enter the private island, even if you have a negative PCR test
* If you choose to stay at another resort before coming to the next resort, you must send them a negative PCR test 48 hours PRIOR arrival.


So you CANNOT do it in the following order:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Local island (they do not care if you have a negative PCR test result with you)
* Resort

You CAN do the following:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort
* Local island 

You CAN also do it like this:

* Arrival by plane with negative PCR test within 96 hours
* Resort - take a PCR test 48 hours prior arrival at next resort 
* Resort 


About the split-stays: it's possible and the place you are staying will do the formalities, just inform them where you are going next. If you can do it, send them an email with this information before going to the Maldives.

I will advice you to contact the resort you are staying at and ask them about the restrictions they have. It seems like the resorts can make their own COVID restrictions..

When are you going?

* 1 tuna can 

Instructions:
1. Slice the onion thinly. Quartering the onion first and then slicing the quarters thinly would make mixing so much easier later on.
2. Mince the curry leaves.
3. Place the onion slices in a bowl, squeeze in the lime, add the githeyo mirus (scotch bonnet pepper) and the salt, and using your fingers mix, squash and squeeze the mixture until the onion releases its juices.
4. Add the grated coconut and curry leaves and mix well again using your fingers.
